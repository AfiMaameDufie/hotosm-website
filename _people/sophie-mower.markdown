Sophie leads the Community Services team, a sub-pillar of HOT’s Community team. Using an open innovation approach, Sophie works closely with regional and functional teams to develop, test, and scale different elements of community support. This includes: 
* Providing workflows to guide user-centred programming
* Facilitating dialogues and learning processes to enable peer-to-peer knowledge sharing
* Enabling the development of strong foundations for best practices for community building initiatives through supporting investment initiatives
* Making actionable recommendations (informed by rigorous people-led research) for sustainable community development 

Sophie joined the HOT team in April 2020 but has been contributing to the HOTs mission as a volunteer since 2017. Sophie’s background is in community development and Inclusive Innovation. Her previous experience includes establishing a Maker Space at the Bahir Dar Institute of Technology in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, and co-founding the First Steps Project, a UK-based non-for-profit that ran workshops and training programs for young people living in areas of deprivation.
