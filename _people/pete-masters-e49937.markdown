I am Pete, brand new Head of Community at HOT. My mission (work in progress) is to help HOT to deliver on its potential as a truly community-centric organisation. I already have a long history with HOT - launching and running the Missing Maps project (at MSF), as an active member of the Missing Maps London community and, finally, as a board member for three years. Previous to here, I worked at MSF for eleven years, starting as the first digital manager and finishing as research and innovation team lead in a medical department. I have a pet hate for acronyms and initialisations and love playing geoguessr.
