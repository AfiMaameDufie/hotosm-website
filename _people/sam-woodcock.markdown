Sam is a software developer with a broad range of interests spanning engineering and DevOps.

He joined HOT as a volunteer in February 2023 to support the FMTM during the Turkey / Syria earthquakes.

He mostly enjoys creating open software tools for the benefit of humanity, but in his downtime you can probably find him either tinkering with his homelab or hiking/cycling half way across the country.
