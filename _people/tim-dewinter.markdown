Tim joined HOT as the Project Factory Coordinator in Latin American Alpha team, bringing more than 30 years of experience in a broad range of social development programmes. The last 6 years of his professional experiences focused on the development of a thinking school and lifelong learning while developing social projects in the Andean regi√≥n of Cusco. 

Prior to joining HOT, Tim worked for UNESCO and UNICEF Peru as Educational consultant, as Country Director in Peru and developed the Research and Training Center for Projects Abroad.  Tim has work experience in many different countries such as India, Ghana, Israel, Argentina, Bolivia, etc. He prefers hands-on experiences with the community at the grass-root level and always tries to learn and share at the same time. Tim graduated from KU Leuven with a masters degree in constructional engineering and later got a second masters degree in Intercultural management and International communication from CIMIC- Thomas More in Belgium. 

Tim is very excited about exploring all the opportunities and possibilities that digital mapping has to offer in order to visualise and help solve real problems.
