Liz has dedicated her career to supporting global teams in carrying out impactful work. She enjoys working behind the scenes to build supportive frameworks, systems & culture to enable non-profit organizations to function and succeed. Her role at HOT allows her to do just that through leading three key internal teams: Finance, People Operations and MERL (monitoring, evaluation, research & learning). Liz’s goal is to continue strengthening HOT’s foundational global and local internal support functions that enable our implementation & innovation teams to successfully engage communities so those communities are visible on the map and involved in decisions that affect their lives. 

Liz’s experience managing various NGOs finance, operations, M&E and program functions brings a versatile perspective to the team. Prior to working for HOT, Liz was the Impact Director at Lwala Community Alliance, a community-based innovator in Western Kenya. Before that she worked at the World Bank, Equip Liberia, the National Academy of Sciences, and the German Marshall Fund. Liz graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies with an MA in Economics and International Development, and from The George Washington University with a BA in Communication and Organizational Studies. She sits on the Board of Directors of Blood:Water Mission, another community-focused organization supporting grassroots organizations in Africa.
