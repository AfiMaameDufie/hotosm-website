Liz dedicates her career to supporting global teams in carrying out impactful work. She enjoys working behind the scenes to build supportive frameworks, systems & culture to enable non-profit organizations to function and succeed. Her role at HOT allows her to do just that through leading HOT's internal central teams whose efforts enable and amplify the regional open mapping hubs' work. Liz’s goal is to continue strengthening HOT’s foundational internal support functions to ultimately ensure that communities are visible on the map and involved in decisions that affect their lives.

Liz has many years' experience in leadership roles at NGOs. Prior to working for HOT, Liz was the Impact Director at Lwala Community Alliance, a community-based innovator in Western Kenya. Before that she worked at the World Bank, Equip Liberia, the National Academy of Sciences, and the German Marshall Fund. Liz graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies with an MA in Economics and International Development, and from The George Washington University with a BA in Communication and Organizational Studies. She is the Treasurer of the Board of Directors at Blood:Water Mission, another community-focused non-profit supporting grassroots health & WASH organizations in Africa.
