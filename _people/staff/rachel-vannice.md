Rachel joined HOT in 2016 with a Bachelors from Boston University in International Relations and a Masters in International Development from Trinity College Dublin. After working with the Peace Corps in Rwanda and with several national and international NGOs, she was still new to mapping. Since then, she's been amazed and remains excited at the potential for mapping to impact development work and humanitarian action across sectors. She's always looking forward to the next mapathon and the next chance to be with the teams in the field.
