As HOT's Director of Programs, I'm overseeing all our mapping projects and teams, such as country teams and projects in Africa, SE Asia and beyond. With a background in software engineering and GIS/LBS (Location-based Services), I have been working with (open) geospatial data since around 2003, and started using OpenStreetMap professionally relatively early.

I've worked with HOT since early 2015, originally managing mapping projects such as "Ramani Huria" in Tanzania, and have continued supporting the growth and expansion of our communities and projects across the world. I immensely enjoy the combination of the educational aspects, local skills and capacity building, and supporting (local) governments and NGOs to incorporate open geospatial data into their thinking, policy and decision making across a wide range of sectors and use cases.
