I'm a French geographer who has lived in Mexico City for almost half of my life, as an urban studies researcher and open / civic data activist through OpenStreetMap, urban mobility focused projects, and projects focused on women and community building like Geochicas (co-founder). I am involved as much as time permits in diversity and inclusion activities in OSM, and I also work with the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico.
