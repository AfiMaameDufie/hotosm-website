My name is Bakole Harriet. I joined HOT in 2017 October as a volunteer working as a data field collector until November 2018 when I joined the remote mapping team to do remote work and field work. I hold a Diploma in Journalism and Public Relations from the Institute of media and Communications Uganda and a certificate in Project Planning and Management from Makerere University. Outside work, I do Radio adverts, Voice Health educative programs, Girl child education and many others. I have done this in different radio stations and individual studios as well. I do Translations from English to my local language, radio drama and direction.
