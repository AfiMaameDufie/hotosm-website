I got actively involved in HOT after partaking in the HOT Data Quality Internship in 2021. I became a member of the Community Working Group and had the chance again to intern as an Online Community Support and Services. Before then, I was actively involved with YouthMappers, where we usually map projects from the HOT Tasking Manager. I am a drone pilot and a Geospatial enthusiast with a keen interest in community management/engagement.
