Founder, OSM Mali
Former HOT Board Member
Member of the League of African Bloggers and Cyber-Activists for Democracy (Africtivistes ) 

I'm also the Representative of the OpenData Community for French Speaking Countries (CAFDO) in Mali.  For more transparency on the Development Aid in Mali, I created the SAIDMali web platform to keep track of the money allocated to development projects.  I'm currently leading the OpenCities in Bamako on behalf of OSM Mali with HOT.
