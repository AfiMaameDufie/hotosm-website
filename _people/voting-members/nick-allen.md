<p>I've spent many years involved in training people in one way or another, including being a lecturer in First Aid, and IT. Very useful to me now as I help to train mappers at Missing Maps Mapathons in London - although I've also trained many in other parts of the country.</p><p>In May 2016 I was part of a Missing Maps Team that visited Sierra Leone, and I was involved in training volunteers in ground survey techniques involving smart phones, together with Aid Workers in using OpenStreetMap data.</p><p>I've picked up any computer skills I may have, in my own way, but long term involvement with OpenStreetMap has led me to research more, and hence kept my interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Although IT is extremely important in what we do, I think the people and their dedication is much more important. The skills can be learnt, especially if we can find a way of making the learning easier. I've done lots of mapping for HOT, and then lots of validating. </p><p>I like the idea that HOT is able to produce training guides that are relevant to the work that is needed. In particular I like the idea that language should not be a barrier, so I'm keen to promote the translation of LearnOSM, as well as producing guides that anyone can understand. I enjoy updating LearnOSM, and look forward to being part of the team that improves it, to keep it the best guide for learning 'how to' for HOT.</p>
