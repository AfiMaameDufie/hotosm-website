I started contributing to OSM in 2012, and first got passionate about humanitarian mapping through my work with Kathmandu Living Labs in Nepal 2013. Since then I kept on mapping, launched the disastermappers heidelberg with some fellow students, and organized numerous mapathons and workshops. Since 2013 I also conduct research around humanitarian mapping. First as member of the GIScience Research Group at Heidelberg university and now as part of HeiGIT. This allows me to also advocate our work at conferences and the wider scientific crowd. I was on the HOT Board of Directors 2018/19.
