Geospatial technology is his passion and he's been working with it nationally and internationally for 13 long years.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">He was involved with OpenSource GIS.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">During his Master’s Degree in Asian Institute of Technology. After coming back to Bangladesh GFDRR’s collaborative open city project gave him the chance to work actively with OpenStreetMap. He has vast working experience with World Bank, American Red Cross, IFRCS, PMTC, DFID, Water Sanitation for Urban Poor (WSUP), BRAC, Water AID, UNDP, FAO, SAVE THE CHILDREN INTERNATIONAL, WFP. A few years back, all of Bangladesh was almost BLANK in OSM. As a GIS geek and supporter of free and opensource projects, he realized the huge potential of OSM in developing Bangladesh, a country with regular disaster threats and top listed for climate impacts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">He started to disseminate this knowledge among people, building a strong OSM community involving academia, government and non government organizations, youth communities, youth entrepreneurs and the local level low-tech community. Voluntarily he facilitated more than 35 OSM trainings and coordinated many more mapping parties in Bangladesh. People hire him for conventional GIS mapping, he introduces OpenStreetMapping; that’s how OSM is spreading among the agencies in Bangladesh. He often writes about opendata and OSM in his personal blog(</span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #2244dd; -webkit-appearance: none; outline: 0px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;" href="http://www.ahasanulhoque.com/category/blog/" rel="nofollow">www.ahasanulhoque.com/category/blog/</a><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21.2113px;">He is a current Board Member, Voting Member of HOT, founder of OSGeo Bangladesh and active memeber of Bangladesh Environmental Graduate Association.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">He believes that to be involved with HOT is a noble work what will serve the community for a long time with a very minimum effort. He is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">campaigning to create more use cases for the OSM data, since "Data have no meaning if there is no use". He thinks, we shouldn’t wait for disaster to use OSM data only; we need to use the OSM data in research and innovation.
