<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">With her background in social and educational studies, Jorieke is a bit of an exception in the OpenStreetMap-world. Yet with her interest in social-spatial issues, the Humanitaran OpenStreetMap Team, quickly became like a second family to her. The past few years she was active in several African countries and Bangladesh to map, promote and train local and international actors on OpenStreetMap. Consequently she has a big heart for local OpenStreetMap communities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
