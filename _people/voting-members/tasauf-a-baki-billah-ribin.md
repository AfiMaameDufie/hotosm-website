Ribin began his career as a Computer Engineer and started working in the humanitarian field over last 5 years. Besides working with both in MSF - Belgium and MSF - Holland in the past, he has always been trying to be an active part of the humanitarian movement by volunteering with UN Volunteers, HOT, SBTF(Standby Task Force), Crisis Mappers & Mapillary. Always proud to introduced as a part of the global humanitarian teams.
History with HOT is now getting long as it crossed 02 years mark, and the dedication became stronger than ever (not difficult, with HOT more amazing than ever).
Became involved with HOT as Pete Masters & Jorieke Vyncke visiting Bangladesh to map Kamrangirchar 
and Hazaribagh areas as a part of MissingMaps project. Therefore, started to disseminate this knowledge among people, started helping others building a strong OSM community. During this period, he actively got involved with the local field mapping projects in various parts of Bangladesh as a part of the projects by Save the Children, Y Care, American Red Cross, Asia Foundation, World Bank & the Asian Development Bank. He believes local OSM groups have the capacity to catalyze the development and growth of OSM around the world.
