Namitala (Trudy Hope) currently works as an independent software and data consultant in Zambia.  She  received her Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and started her own IT firm in addition to the OSM Zambia community. She is a data enthusiast who contributes to OpenStreetMap, advocates for the use of open data and a software developer. She is part of the OSM Africa community and supports humanitarian data. In March 2016, she developed the first open community map in Zambia involving women as a way of supporting water sanitation and hygiene. She has trained community members, government officials and students on how to contribute to OSM and the use of open data. Together with the Decentralization for Development program supported by the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), OSM Zambia piloted the use of OSM as a tool to be used by councils for integrated development planning. She supports women organizations encouraging the use of OSM to address SDG5 and she believes all software developed should be opensource.
