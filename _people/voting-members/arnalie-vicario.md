I map for work and volunteerism.

I started being involved in HOT Projects in late 2016 when I joined a resiliency project to map 17 priority provinces (most vulnerable to typhoon/flooding) in the Philippines. Back in 2015, I was one of the GIS Specialist for the WebSAFE (Web-based Scenario Assessment of Hazards For Emergencies) Project, a localized version of InaSAFE, where we used OSM data for exposure layer (building footprints). In my current work and studies, I also use OSM data for GIS mapping and analysis. Additionally, I am a member of GeoLadies PH, an advocacy group for community diversity, collaborative participation, and affirmative spaces especially for women, and under-represented communities in OpenStreetMap.
