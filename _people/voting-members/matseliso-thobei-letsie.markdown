Matseliso Thobei Letsie (tshedy) has been OSM mapper since February 2015 and got enthusiastic about the change she was making in #MapLesotho.  She doesn't only map Lesotho but other countries as well that invite mappers on social media for humanitarian help. In the past years she has held OSM trainings and mapathons in Lesotho and in Ireland to share her skills with others. She is part of OSM Africa and in her opinion OSM has helped her to network with other people and refer to them for help.
Being a spatial planner she realised the importance of OpenSteetMap data and how it is useful in her job as she uses the data in QGIS for analysis and to creating maps and spatial plans. She has been able to achieve all this with a support she got from Fingal County Council in Ireland.
