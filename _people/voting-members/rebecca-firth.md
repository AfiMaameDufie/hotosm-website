Rebecca is the Executive Director of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). HOT is an international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. HOT’s vision is a world where community needs are addressed through mapping, everyone can access and contribute to the map, and open map data is available and used for impact.

Before stepping into the role of Executive Director, Rebecca served as Interim Executive Director and Senior Director of Strategy & Program. In that role, Rebecca managed HOT’s Community, Partnerships, and Communications activities, and oversaw HOT’s global expansion into four Regional Open Mapping Hubs (Asia Pacific, Eastern & Southern Africa, West & Northern Africa, Latin America & Caribbean). She has worked to improve HOT’s capabilities to provide longer-term capacity building for OpenStreetMap communities through training and microgrants, grow OpenStreetMap use amongst NGOs and other partners, and share HOT’s message globally with new volunteers and partners. Rebecca also led HOT’s Audacious Project application in 2020, including delivering [a TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people?language=en).

Rebecca joined HOT in 2016 after working in digital and innovation consulting at Accenture. She holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Geography from the University of Cambridge UK, where she focused on international development. She has lived and worked in Borneo, Japan, Colombia, and Peru, focusing on public health, education, disaster reduction, and organizational operations. Rebecca currently resides in London, UK.
