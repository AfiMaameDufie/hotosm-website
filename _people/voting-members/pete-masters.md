Pete was a big fan of OSM as a user first (OSMAnd when travelling) and then as a mapper when he found HOT.Pete is interested in innovation, project management, mapping, community building, communications and operations. He also loves a bit of carpentry when he has time!Pete works as Medical Innovation Officer. Previously, he launched and coordinated the Missing Maps Project, also for MSF. As a member of the HOT board, he tries to ensure that real impact for humanitarian organisations and local communities is at the heart of everything we do.
