All disasters begin and end locally. HOT’s vision is to strengthen local resilience and preparedness. Communities are challenged with the ripple effects beyond climate change itself, including floods, extreme heat, and food scarcity. 

Individual citizens must have a role in identifying and understanding these risks. Gaps in training, tools, resources, and data availability exclude them as part of the solution. Because data and power are not evenly distributed in our world, those most impacted are left disconnected without access to solve their challenges.

It is urgent to take measures to mitigate the climate crisis that threatens the survival of 1 billion+ people. Open data and accessible software by and for communities are among the safest diagnostic and prevention tools to anticipate and cope with such consequences. HOT offers solutions that catalyze optimal, equitable responses.

Here are five projects in which HOT, global and local partners, and communities have worked together to generate OpenStreetMap data, create maps and models for decision-makers, and train community members and municipal employees to create and use geodata for climate and disaster resilience.
