Intro Text: HOT's Community Microgrant program provides support for OpenStreetMap
  (OSM) Communities in low- and middle-income countries with the resources they need
  to launch and grow their activities and impact. Microgrants enable communities to
  implement their mapping activities, improve the availability and quality of map
  data in OSM, aid the development of leadership and technology skills, and help communities
  with disaster response efforts.

  Point1: We provide technological solutions to enable everyone to create and use
    open mapping data, and focus on how we can lower the barrier to entry for everyone
    to do so.
  Point2: We do not build alone. We collaborate with volunteers, universities, Research
    Institutions, SMEs, internships, contractors and even large corporations.
  Point3: We focus on key gaps in the current ecosystem that block community members
    in our target countries to map and use map data.

At HOT, open mapping communities and program teams face  unique challenges in how we work with data:

- Using the OpenStreetMap platform allows for greater reach and accessibility of data, which is at the heart of our work. However, this can  lead to unintended exposure to risk and the potential for misuse of data. As a result,  we need to identify and mitigate any potential risks and harm.
- Data we contribute to OpenStreetMap will be available online for a long time. With that in mind, we also need to anticipate potential  future risks and harm.

So how do Data Principles address these challenges?

Our Data Principles formulate and communicate a clear standard, providing transparency and trustworthiness about how we treat and work with data. Additionally, they serve as the touchstone and framework for responsible & ethical data policies, and to inform data quality & data collection priorities.

Our Data Principles have been developed alongside HOT’s updated and renewed values, and serve as guidelines for all other parts of our Protection Framework. The purpose of the Protection Framework is to provide the guidance, procedures and policies to ensure that we uphold HOT’s responsible data and ethical practices to protect people from harm.

Spatial data and mapping activities can create risk or cause harm for people and communities. For example, map data may enable finding people based on their religion or other beliefs, exposure or proximity to disease, or presence in areas of conflict. HOT has a responsibility to understand, assess, mitigate and protect against risk and harm arising from activities we undertake or support.

The Data Principles capture the most important aspects we need to consider and act on, around how we work with data. Each of the Principles includes a set of guidelines that provide actionable advice, and will link out to more and more resources as more parts of our Protection Framework and tools are completed:
