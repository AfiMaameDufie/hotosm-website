This 2018 we applied and were successful in our proposal for a HOT microgrant to strengthen the OSM Colombian Community. Our focus is on supporting local administrations and communities to prepare risk management plan, an obligation for POT (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) approval. Part of our approved grant budget was the purchase of mapping equipment, and our valuable experience of buying equipment is part of what we want to share, because, although for us buying equipment is a normal transaction that we have done for years, we know that not everyone knows the possibilities of buying online, the difficulties, the vendor facilities and what should be taken into account for a successful purchase.

The first thing is that we have a virtual mailbox that provides the Colombia postal service 472, thanks to this we can order the equipment by Amazon with delivery to a postal address in Miami, from there they are sent to Colombia and arrive directly at a Valle del Cauca remote municipality in the rural area where we live some members of the OSM Colombian community, this is important because until a couple of years ago only the main cities could achieve this, this mean de-centralization and distribution around the territory; Ulloa our town is located in a strategic place between 4 departments Risaralda, Quind√≠o, Valle del Cauca and Caldas and near Cauca, Tolima and others at less than 4 four hours road. The purchase can be made through any credit card or even an E-card, a virtual card, a service provided by a Colombian Bank that provides the necessary data for a credit card transaction, such as expiration number, CCV2 which is the security code, and the card number, this card is charged through the savings account with the bank and there isn't a physical card; even though, for this particular case since the funds come in dollars and do the transfers to local banks can take time and also generate high costs, we use a service called Payonner https://www.payoneer.com/es/ that allows receiving payments and global transfers; it works like a virtual bank account in the Bank of America that provides all the necessary data to be able to generate the transactions and an institution that supports them.

Already having the equipment in our hands, we have paid special attention to a frequent question when there is money, equipment purchase and financial transactions towards an institution whether formalized or not, in our case, being formalized is an added value, but more important is each action traceability that the community generates especially, but not only, when there is money involved. The OpenStreetMap Colombia foundation has been formalized for three years, but more than 10 years working organically; formalization represents a challenge for any organic organization, many people who have participated organically move away when there is formalization, and others who had not participated before arrive in the community because more serious opportunities may arise, in the course of everything, misunderstandings about money management, project appropriation, credits and others may happen; so that this doesn't happen, we believe that the best way is the constant recording of everything we do even before the formalization happens, it is an indispensable step to learn to value what we do, what we earn, what we achieve and also what we lose. To achieve this, that it seems like a difficult task when there is no boss or a line of command demanding this record, we use a platform that we are developing and strengthening for 3 years Tupale.co; the platform is a tool to do tools and through these we have created our own Participatory Information System where we try for the moment and every time looking to do it better, keep a record of what we are responsible for.

From this topic we created the Value Inventory registry [https://fosm.openstreetmap.co/p565](https://fosm.openstreetmap.co/p565), in this record we carry the data related to the reference of the equipment, a photo, the number of units, the person in charge and how the equipment can be accessed if required by any person in the community for its own purposes such as giving workshops, talks or doing field work. We have talked about these equipments ownership, often they are lost in time; knowing who has them and what utility does it give to the equipment is very important to strengthen communities, we think that by keeping this register, those responsible for having them can be renewed when the current manager is no longer giving them constant use or can not put them at the community service. Keeping this record, we feel, gives the ability to the entire community to carry out an audit, to require the equipment when it is considered and to know which are the assets that belong to the community and also know who has better skills to use them. The person in charge is always, on a provisional basis, the most apt to generate value through the element of which he is responsible.

In this process we also explore another record that we consider valuable, and that is also an asset of a community that, since it is not well referenced and followed up, can generate great misunderstandings and losses. This value is the Contacts Network, for example, in the development of the 2018 HOT microgrant process, we are seeing how this network grows; we were contacted by the International Red Cross because, in a confluent way, they were also working in Tolima the place where we will also do our field work, and they also contact us with the people who linked to their process to strengthen the network jointly, from here we started to create a tool to also leave a consolidation of this record, with this tool we register elements such as contact information, name, email and telephone, who makes the contact and in which context. We believe that it is very important to recognize that when we make a contact when we represent a community, we do it in part thanks to the work that the community does, that although there are also implicit personal skills, management and logistics participating in events, congresses or in our day to day, these contacts exist thanks to the community activity context and therefore belong to it; when a person leaves a community, stops working there and has done a job with institutions or people creating contacts and if this person has not left the knowledge to another community member, processes are lost, contacts are difficult to recover and sometimes if we want to recover this network, we have to start over.At this moment we have the doubt if this network should be private or public, maybe a part of the data of these networks should be open or be for community internal use only , we would like to receive the comments of those who want to participate.

In the same way that we carry these records we also feed others related to income, expenses, and one that we will activate with the microgrant development is the Open Resources [https://fosm.openstreetmap.co/s555](https://fosm.openstreetmap.co/s555)where we will publish the learning, findings and suggestions as a printable digital primer about what is required for a locality to move forward in its risk management plan and to do so in a participatory way through the OpenStreetMap ecosystem tools use, generating a medium and long-term impact, investing resources wisely and enhancing local skills.

We are preparing to advance in our field work, which consists of two general phases, the drone flights to create the orthophotos and the training and workshops where we will improve the Chaparral Tolima area map, providing the material so that the administration and the related institutions advance their risk management plan indispensable for the territorial ordering plan approval and where today there is a great void at all National levels.\
