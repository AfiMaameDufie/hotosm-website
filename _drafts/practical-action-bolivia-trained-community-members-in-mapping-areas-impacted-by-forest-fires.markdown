[Practical Action Bolivia](http://practicalaction.org.bo/quienes-somos/) has established the [HOT Chiquitania](https://sites.google.com/view/hotchiquitania) mapping community as part of their now complete microgrant project to map areas of Bolivia struck by last yearâ€™s devastating forest fires in the Amazon. In Bolivia alone, the fires destroyed more than three million hectares, causing widespread damage to the biodiversity, killing animals, and harming livelihoods.

Practical Action Bolivia hosted eight trainings to support the affected communities, training 52 people, 22 of whom were women, and created a site with [training resources](https://sites.google.com/view/mapeocomunitario-pabol/inicio) in Spanish. With the mapping skills they gained, the community mapped over 10 thousand buildings and 10 thousand kilometers of road in the affected areas.

This community-generated map data helps the community to understand where forest fires have destroyed crops and infrastructure and ecosystems are in critical condition.
