After any disaster, good data is critical to inform life-saving and sustaining activities, and eventually recovery programs. Since 2010 and the [devastating earthquake in Haiti](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/haiti_), Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and the wider OpenStreetMap (OSM) community have provided spatial data to inform disaster response and recovery.  OSM’s ability to quickly provide up-to-date maps and geospatial crowdsourced data, and integration with other technologies and accessibility make it an invaluable resource for disaster response efforts.

During the [Syria-Turkey earthquake in February 2023](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/eq-2023-000015-tur), OSM is again proving a valuable resource, allowing responders to quickly access up-to-date maps and geospatial data to aid in search and rescue efforts, contextualize and access damage assessments, and plan relief and recovery efforts. 

Applications of OSM data use in an earthquake disaster response include:

Basemaps and key infrastructure reference layers: OSM data provides context for where major roads and populated areas are, as well as the location of aid distribution centers, pharmacies, medical facilities, and other key resources. Basemaps and roads from OSM of the most common datasets included in early maps of an affected region, while specific infrastructure information is used to identify what type of services are likely to be impacted or still in service. 

DOWNLOAD OSM ROADS (Download for [Turkey](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tur_roads), [Syria](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_syr_roads))

OSM data can also be combined with other data sources, such as damage analyses, to create models and maps that can help with recovery planning and decision-making. For example, The World Bank used OSM as an input for infrastructure modeling to give context to satellite detected damage in Turkey in their report: [Global Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE), Türkiye Report.](https://reliefweb.int/report/turkiye/global-rapid-post-disaster-damage-estimation-grade-report-february-6-2023-kahramanmaras-earthquakes-turkiye-report) (Information on OSM and damage dataset examples and methodologies coming soon).
