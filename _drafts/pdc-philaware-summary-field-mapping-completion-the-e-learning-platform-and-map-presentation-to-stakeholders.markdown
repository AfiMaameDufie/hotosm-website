  prepares e-Learning platform to remotely support trainings

Over the past few months, we [shared articles documenting the progress of the PhilAWARE project](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/data-driven-disaster-risk-management-philaware/). A collaboration with the USAID and the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) launched in July 2019, PhilAWARE is described as a custom hazard monitoring and early warning system to improve disaster management and decision making in the Philippines.  Supported by PetaBencana.id, PhilAWARE is supposed to equip the Philippinesâ€™ National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) with a hazard monitoring, early warning, and decision support tool.\
\
HOT Philippines is a key partner in the PhilAWARE project, tasked to fill the gaps in the critical geospatial data needed for DRRM by collecting local geospatial information including neighborhood boundary information, transportation and critical lifeline assets such as hospitals, schools, police, and fire stations.

Throughout the project duration, HOT Philippines focused on remote mapping, OSM training, and field mapping. In March 2021, the HOT Philippines field mapping team has completed the field work required by the donors, and are presenting the output maps to the local government units (LGUs; concerned municipalities or cities).

## Field mapping and training completion

* 18/22 municipalities trained

## e-Learning

In order to remotely support trainings of local government units (LGUs) and other stakeholders, HOT Philippines is working on an e-Learning platform. Topics in learning chapters include introductions to HOT and OSM, using the Tasking Manager, Data Validation, and downloading OSM data.
