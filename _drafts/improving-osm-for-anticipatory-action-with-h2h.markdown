The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is excited to improve the humanitarian usability of open spatial data through OpenStreetMap (OSM) as part of [H2Hâ€™s Anticipatory Action Accelerator](
https://h2hnetwork.org/enhancing-h2h-action-for-anticipatory-response/
). With support from the H2H, HOT will be working on some of the spatial datasets that are most foundational for when a disaster hits:
1. Populated places - used to identify the location and scope of affected communities in a humanitarian crisis
2. Roads -  used to plan access to affected populations and communities
