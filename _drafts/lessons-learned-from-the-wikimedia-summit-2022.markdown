Summary Text: On September 9-11, 2022, I attended the [Wikimedia Summit 2022](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Summit_2022)
  in Berlin, Germany as a representative of the Wikimedia Community User Group in
  Uganda. As someone who belongs to several communities, I was interested in learning
  from the Wikimedia community lessons that could be replicated by the OpenStreetMap
  community.
