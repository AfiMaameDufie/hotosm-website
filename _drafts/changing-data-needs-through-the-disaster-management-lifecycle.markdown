We’re now about a month and a half after the initial 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, back on Monday, February 6th. Even though it is an ongoing emergency with vast humanitarian needs, we are now moving into a phase of ongoing support to the affected communities, and the start of rebuilding and reconstruction efforts where it is feasible to do. As such, we’d like to explain a bit more about the different data needs, and data and quality requirements, in different phases of a disaster response.

During each phase of the ‘disaster management cycle’, there are different data needs, uses, and requirements. Let’s first take a brief look at the different phases.

Data availability & uses: OSM data across the disaster management cycle
Response: activities immediately following a disaster event to help affected people, include life saving search and rescue, and meeting of basic humanitarian needs: water, food, clothing, medical aid, shelter, etc. Initial activities include looking at OSM data availability and needs assessments, procuring as much pre and post event open imagery as we can source (both satellite and UAV), and supporting damage assessments, humanitarian, and logistical needs.

Recovery: returning the situation to normal (or better and more resilient than before) conditions and circumstances for affected people. The focus is still meeting basic needs, but is shifting to more thorough safety and damage assessments, cleanup, and rebuilding and reconstruction.

Preparedness: planning and preparation to improve local capacity and resilience to cope with future events and emergencies. Often, a separate “mitigation” phase is defined between recovery and preparedness, which focuses on prevention and reducing the likelihood of effects and impacts. In this case when looking at (geospatial) data needs, we’re combining with preparedness.

Data requirements and quality: approaching evolving data quality needs at HOT
As the data use differs for each phase of a response, so do the expectations and requirements on the data itself. Often, higher data quality standards are expected on data in ‘stable’ locations and times than in the immediate disaster response phase.

During the immediate Response phase, data availability is key - and data quality is often good enough as long as it doesn’t hamper the primary use for the data. For example, while annoying, overlapping or non-square buildings don’t actually cause population estimates to be off significantly. However, major roads that don’t connect do cause inability to route logistics and navigate. Comprehensive data can be scarce and hard to get by initially, especially if we’re dealing with an area that hasn’t been mapped well in the past. The pace of mapping TM tasks will invariably outpace data quality checks and validation.

To complement tasking and data creation, we run a  (data) Protection Risk Assessment to ensure we consider local risk factors, potential harms of mapping, and think of improvements and mitigations. For example, we are careful of issues around representation and exclusion of rural populations or ethnic groups by means of our tasking areas and definition, and what types of infrastructure we request (or don’t request) to be mapped.

During Recovery, our focus will generally shift to putting a concerted effort into data cleanup and validation. Also, we may be supporting specific recovery efforts, such as more comprehensive damage assessments, providing ongoing humanitarian assistance to (improvised) shelter and camps, and planning of reconstruction efforts. This does require data to be of higher quality overall, and link to or incorporate additional data items, such as addressing details.

In Preparedness, high data quality and fidelity is required - especially when considering specific project implementation in areas such as disaster risk reduction, resilience, or anticipatory action. Often, data collection and mapping outputs will go towards providing decision making data and baseline information on specific interventions and investments. Examples of this are projects such as the Open Cities programs, which might require detailed and high quality data on the exact layout and capacity of drainage and water systems, public transport systems, or health facilities.
