We’re now about a month and a half after the initial 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, back on Monday, February 6th. Even though it is an ongoing emergency with vast humanitarian needs, we are now moving into a phase of ongoing support to the affected communities, and the start of rebuilding and reconstruction efforts where it is feasible to do. As such, we’d like to explain a bit more about the different data needs, and data and quality requirements, in different phases of a disaster response.

During each phase of the ‘disaster management cycle’, there are different data needs, uses, and requirements. Let’s first take a brief look at the different phases.

Data availability & uses: OSM data across the disaster management cycle
Response: activities immediately following a disaster event to help affected people, include life saving search and rescue, and meeting of basic humanitarian needs: water, food, clothing, medical aid, shelter, etc. Initial activities include looking at OSM data availability and needs assessments, procuring as much pre and post event open imagery as we can source (both satellite and UAV), and supporting damage assessments, humanitarian, and logistical needs.

Recovery: returning the situation to normal (or better and more resilient than before) conditions and circumstances for affected people. The focus is still meeting basic needs, but is shifting to more thorough safety and damage assessments, cleanup, and rebuilding and reconstruction.
