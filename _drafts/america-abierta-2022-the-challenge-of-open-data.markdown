During the last week of September it was held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, the “[América Abierta](https://americaabierta.org/)” (Open America) event -formerly known as AbreLatam/ConDatos- a series of activities and conferences on open data and open government, which brings together specialists from throughout the region to talk and create synergies about data, government, civil society and communities.
