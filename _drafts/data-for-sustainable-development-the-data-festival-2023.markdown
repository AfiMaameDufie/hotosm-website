After participating in AbreLatam 2023 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the Open Mapping Hub team moved to Punta del Este, where the Data Festival would be held from November 7 to 9, organized by The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data: under the auspices of the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the Ministry of Tourism and the Agency for Electronic Government and Information and Knowledge Society (AGESIC), of Uruguay.

This was the second edition of the Festival, since the first was held in Bristol, UK, from March 21 to 23, 2018. On that occasion the objectives were:

Convene members, funders and stakeholders to inspire and innovate

Connect communities of experts to share progress and discuss challenges and solutions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Catalyze action, bring together initiatives and forge progress ahead of the World Data Forum and the 73rd UN General Assembly in the short term, and in the long term until 2030.

For this edition, although these objectives remained, emphasis was placed on others such as:

Rapid technological innovations and timely collection, access and use of data are needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. However, the data revolution also raises fundamental tensions around power, privacy and participation. The Data Festival aims to strengthen data communities and our collective ability to unlock the value of data for all as we strive to achieve the 2030 Agenda.

The Data Festival program consisted of a diverse mix of roundtables, presentations, lightning talks, workshops and networking spaces. From the open mapping Hub, we wanted to respond to this diversity of activities by maximizing interaction with regional actors. We present sessions focused on dialogue, experience exchange, brainstorming, and interactivity with attendees to demonstrate the uses and applications of open cartography and its tools.

For example, we had a "drill" session on Humanitarian Mapping in reaction to disasters, with a brief introduction to disaster mapping and then moving on to the emergency drill in which attendees assumed the roles of the various entities involved in the support. post-disaster humanitarian aid and act accordingly.

Another of our sessions was an induction to open mapping with open source mobile applications to map elements outside the conference room, as an activity to raise awareness of the cartographic act. Attendees became familiar with the applications and returned to share impressions and doubts, and about possible uses in their professional field linked to public policy or research.

We also carry out a couple of activities aimed at children, one with basic mapping and another with drone management and flying. As you can see in the photos, the kids not only learned but had fun in the process.

Additionally, within the event, we organized a breakfast discussion with representatives of national statistics institutes from Paraguay, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Suriname and Jamaica. The objective was to discuss the challenges in terms of access to basic cartography for their census exercises and monitoring of population dynamics. We also discussed the possible contributions of OpenStreetMap at a general level.

We also had a booth in the main hall that became our operations center and where those interested in open cartography and our projects came, which allowed us to (re)connect with many colleagues. All of this was enhanced by the presence and active participation of our regional director Fabrizio Scrollini and our Executive Director Rebecca Firth, who was interviewed for several organizations:

Rebecca -after the event- reflected on the positive change in attitude among the attending government officials, that unlike in the first edition of the Festival where citizen data was not seen as well by government representatives, now there was a genuine interest in getting involved in data generation processes. She also commented:

How can you make collaborations work when there can be a very large gap between rhetoric and reality in the data sector? The sustainable development data sector is very complex and there are many opposing forces within it. Some examples are: data that is available globally vers
