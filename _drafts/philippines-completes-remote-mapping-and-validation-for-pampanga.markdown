As of 1:21 p.m. on September 21, our Technical and GIS Specialist, Feye Andal, reported the completion of all remote mapping and validation tasks for Pampanga, a pilot area for the PhilAWARE project:

> Good afternoon! As of 1:21PM, we have completed all the validation tasks for #MAPampanga in TM4.

Here is a [visual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feyeandal/photos/master/Pampanga_animated.gif) of the project’s progress (building footprints and roads mapped) from January to September 2020.

It must be noted that prior to HOT Philippines’ activities in the area, members of the local DRRM community and OSM Philippines have contributed in mapping Pampanga. In the [before-and-after maps below](https://twitter.com/HOTOSM_Ph/status/1294516877390041090) (published on August 8 for #OpenStreetMap16), you can see that some municipalities such as Guagua have been already well-mapped in the “before” images.

**Field Work**

The HOT team members based in Pampanga also began field mapping on August 19, as mentioned in our previous update. Despite challenges in movement and schedules due to specialized lockdowns, the team is able to proceed with their tasks with caution and permission from the local government units (LGU) in Pampanga. They currently working on mapping their fourth municipality.

Simultaneously, other members of the team are coordinating with members of and volunteers from the local government units (LGU) in Pampanga for OSM trainings. You can find culture trivia and regular documentation of HOT Philippines’ field mapping and training activities on our Instagram: that’s [@hotosm_ph](https://www.instagram.com/hotosm_ph/), in the “Field: Pampanga” highlight.

**Partnerships and Speaking Engagements**

Aside from field work, members of our team also actively participated in partnerships and events as speakers and panelists:

* Bry Damasco, our Country Manager, was a speaker during the launch of [MapaKalamidad.ph](https://mapakalamidad.ph), and was a panelist at NSCM Online’s Citizen Science Webinar

* Sen Roxas, our Training Manager, was a speaker for the fifth session of @ScoutinginAPR’s Webinar Series for SDGs

* Feye Andal, our Technical and GIS Specialist, was a speaker for MapBek’s JOSM Training

**Commitment to Telling Our Narrative**

This month was also a time for the whole of HOT to reflect and reassess the way our stories are told. In the global scale, HOT Philippines is participating in the creation of a Comms Guidance Document to share with corporate partners who plan to feature HOT work in the future. The aim is to uphold the dignity and properly tell the stories of the communities we work with and live in.

We are also continuously collecting stories for #MAPAsinoKaMan—a campaign which we started last month.
