On April 27, 2024, after two weeks of intense rains in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, the collapse of the 14 de julio hydroelectric dam worsened the critical situation of historic floods in Porto Alegre. This event resulted in over 100 deaths and 100 missing persons, affecting more than one million people. Approximately 70,000 were evacuated, and over a million homes were left without clean water. Additionally, 421,000 households lost electricity, 115 municipalities lost phone and internet services, 61 roads were blocked, and Porto Alegre's airport was closed. The Guaíba River reached record levels, flooding the city's historic center.

This marked the state's second significant disaster in less than a year, following a cyclone in September 2023 that claimed at least 31 lives. Climate change and the El Niño phenomenon have intensified extreme weather conditions in the region.

On May 9, 2024, in response to this disaster, the Open Mapping Hub in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC Hub) launched an activation to support response efforts, driven by discussions with the OSM Brazil community. This initiative was supported by mapping communities from several universities, the Humanitarian Mapping Brigade, various Youthmappers chapters: Youthmappers UERGS, Youthmappers UFRJ, Mapeadores Livres UFPR and Youthmappers UFV, and other independent mappers.

This effort focused on updating the already well-developed map in the hardest-hit areas and negotiating access to post-disaster imagery. To date, 22 mapping projects have been published covering: 55,629 buildings; 2,326 km of roads; 2,062 km² of area mapped, and 8,612 mapped tasks. This effort led to a crucial partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Together, we focused on creating and gathering high-quality geographic data for the Porto Alegre prefecture and aiding in damage assessments of public facilities for rapid recovery. Additionally, we developed new interfaces providing useful tools for the population, facilitating response in the most affected areas.

# **Collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank**

From June 15 to July 15, 2024, the LAC Hub collaborated with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the departments of education, health, sports, and social assistance of the Porto Alegre government to address flood damages. This collaboration focused on developing and testing an initial georeferenced assessment method for affected facilities and data systematization, proposing a participatory campaign for cartographic monitoring of recovery in the coming months. The main goal is to support local efforts in developing and implementing reconstruction and transformation plans in the most affected areas, promoting community participation and ensuring an inclusive and sustainable approach.

The HOT team, led by Céline Jacquin, Everton Bortollini, and Juan Melo, developed a survey methodology to diagnose damages to public and social facilities. This tool was co-designed with local officials and civil engineers from the IDB to gather valuable information for both the municipal government and funders. The damages are significant, with buildings submerged up to three meters for over a month, causing severe material and structural damage, and total losses in many cases.

Céline emphasized the importance of organizing information to prioritize necessary actions:

During visits to clinics, schools, sports facilities, and triage centers, the team observed the impact of the floods, which lasted between 30 and 40 days, creating unsanitary conditions and significant structural damage. The prefecture is publishing georeferenced data on its spatial data infrastructure, centralizing information from each department for availability to both the population and the city hall. This will enable better coordination and response in future emergency events.

# **BID Mission Activities Recap in Porto Alegre**

The mission began with an opening meeting with Secretary Schirmer. Subsequently, working sessions were held with counterparts from the educational sector, and the Fundação de Assistência Social e Cidadania (FASC), sectors of the Municipal Secretariat of Sports, Recreation and Youth (SMELJ), and health, the georeferencing team of the Municipality of Porto Alegre, and the Municipal Secretary of Innovation, focused on identifying and georeferencing buildings to diagnose, review previous information and diagnoses, and prioritize missing information, including reviewing the questionnaire for recovery executive plans and works.

The second day included field visits to more areas of Sarandí and the Historic Center, with sectoral teams.

Accompanied by military personnel who have traveled from Rio de Janeiro to provide support, we explore how the school community is adapting and responding to current circumstances.*

Céline emphasized that, "electrical facilities have suffered irrecoverable oxidation, and industrial machinery, work equipment, and administrative documentation have been destroyed. Wooden and metal furniture has also been affected, while plastic objects and installations have fared better. Water movement has shattered windows, lightweight structures, and doors."

The third day was dedicated to systematizing information and updates based on field visits, as well as meetings with managers of the Project Coordination Unit (UCP) and the IDB. In the afternoon, a closing meeting was held with Mayor Sebastião Melo and a working session at the Municipal Administrative Center (CAM) to plan next steps and coordinate information gathering, along with the Planning Secretariat and sectoral counterparts.

On the fourth day, visits were made to two garbage triage warehouses in an area heavily affected by its low position relative to the river, testing an evaluation instrument and generating audio and video documentation.

In this mission, we made visits to co-design diagnostic instruments understanding different needs and perspectives, and trained officials to capture information in these forms, which were tested at triage and solid waste recycling centers.

On Friday, June 21, meetings were held with students from the Pontifical Catholic University and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as with the Directorate of Educational Technological Innovation of the Porto Alegre Prefecture, to discuss future collaboration in monitoring recovery efforts.

We are developing a collaborative strategy to monitor equipment recovery once reconstruction work begins. We aim to involve university students, coordinators, graduate students, and Youth Mappers in this participatory effort.

# **Methodology**

We worked with the IDB on diagnosing the climatic event in Porto Alegre, systematizing data, and formulating a questionnaire to assist in initial decisions on the recovery of public infrastructure. We also integrated this data into existing management systems of the prefecture, ensuring its effectiveness.

Juan and Everton pointed out that the mission's objective is to develop methodologies with free technologies that interoperate with local government, creating alternative information through community platforms for more effective recovery. "We are mapping facilities on OpenStreetMap and collecting cartographic results, using tools like Mapillary to provide georeferenced photos of the current state of infrastructure," they explained. In this [link](https://www.mapillary.com/app/org/hotosm_lac?lat=-30.02390654431528&lng=-51.2122723780588&z=15.217550359101017&pKey=1257979585608018&menu=false), you can review the viewer of 12,216 images taken in the field by the HOT team.

During the mission, "we explored bridges between technologies like Mapillary and UMAP, managed by the population to generate secondary information, which is unified with official data for more precise and rapid decision-making," Juan commented. Everton highlighted advances in building the prefecture's spatial data infrastructure and collaboration to present this data in accessible visualizations for the population.

Juan concluded: "We are compiling surveys and publishing data in the prefecture's infrastructure, importing them into OSM to ensure their correct location and completeness. We also provided technical advice to the prefecture to improve its spatial data infrastructure using GeoNode and open-source technologies."

# **Conclusion**

Our ultimate goal is to complement and unify data and organizations to provide effective support to the population in this challenging time. We hope that the results of this mission can be applied to other emergencies and, above all, that our work benefits those who need it most now.

In collaboration with the IDB, the prefecture, and third-sector organizations, we seek to provide both public companies and other governments with the most comprehensive view of the situation in Porto Alegre for decision-making and contribute to its improvement.

This mission has demonstrated how collaboration between the OSM community, HOT, and the IDB can lead to effective and coordinated responses in disaster recovery, integrating data and technology to make a lasting impact on the community.
