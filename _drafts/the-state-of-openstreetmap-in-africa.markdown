Ahead of the [State of the Map 2020 conference](https://2020.stateofthemap.org/), which was supposed to take in place in Africa for the first time, but was held online due to COVID-19, OSM Africa surveyed OpenStreetMap community leaders in different countries in Africa, to assess the state of OpenStreetMap in their countries. We heard back from 52 out of the 55 countries in Africa and the results were [presented at the conference](https://youtu.be/gHqmQp7gbqE).

OSM Africa is a network of OpenStreetMap communities from all over Africa working together to grow OpenStreetMap on the continent.

The brightest spots on the [map above](https://tyrasd.github.io/osm-node-density/#4/3.03/-0.70/latest,places) illustrate substantial amounts of OpenStreetMap node density in different places in Africa.

This [visualization](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2648157/) shows the total number of mapped buildings per year in each country from 2007 to 2020. It also shows the history and journey of OpenStreetMap editing in Africa.

By June 2020, there was a total of 57,766,001 mapped buildings in Africa, with Tanzania leading at 11 million, thanks to the work done there by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), the World Bank through Ramani Huria and Crowd2Map Tanzania.
