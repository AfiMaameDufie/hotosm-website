title: Gaza OSM Buildings Update 2024
date: 2024-08-09 21:06:00 Z
Summary Text: 'As damage reaches record levels in the Gaza Strip, the need to understand
  baseline infrastructure in comparison with current damage estimates is critical
  to inform humanitarian planning. **Expert volunteers for HOT have recently completed
  a 5 month effort to create the most comprehensive building footprints dataset available
  for Gaza pre-October 2023, using OpenStreetMap**. Over 157,000 buildings have been
  added to the dataset, with thousands more improvements to existing data. '

Increased conflict since October 2023 has caused a prolonged humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, and massive damage is only complicating the situation. For humanitarian data analysts to understand what buildings are and are not damaged, a full understanding of pre-conflict buildings is needed as a baseline. Efforts to utilize AI and existing OSM datasets for this full baseline have been challenging as the datasets were not completely accurate. The area’s buildings were too dense, and information on the ground was impossible to collect safely. 

HOT’s remote and crowdsourced mapping methodology can collect detailed information visible on aerial imagery in hard to reach areas. In areas that are hard to reach due to conflict, HOT always balances data needs with [responsible data practices](https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data/data-principles/), based on the context.

Based on consultation with humanitarian and UN actors working on Gaza, HOT began [volunteer based work](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Gaza_Update_2024) in February 2024 to create a complete pre-conflict dataset of all building footprints in Gaza in OpenStreetMap. Work by volunteers to adjust existing buildings and add new buildings was coordinated using [HOT’s Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/). Due to protection and data quality concerns, only expert teams were assigned to map and validate the area.

The updated data is live in OpenStreetMap and available via [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_pse_buildings?) or [HOT’s Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org/v3/). 

## What’s next? 

Now that all buildings in Gaza pre-conflict are reflected in OSM, data analysts can track which buildings are functional and which are destroyed. Eventually we will be able to track demolition, and rebuilding when the context allows. 

With increasing complex emergencies displacing a [record](https://www.unhcr.org/us/global-trends) number of people globally, aid organizations are struggling to keep up. HOT’s approach to utilize trained volunteers to gather human-verified data on hard to reach areas is more important than ever. **There are many ways to get involved with our efforts. Contact us at info@hotosm.org to partner, volunteer, or donate to ongoing efforts in conflict affected areas worldwide**.
