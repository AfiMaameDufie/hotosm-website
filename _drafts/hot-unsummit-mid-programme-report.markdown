title: HOT unSummit - Mid-Programme Report (English)
date: 2022-11-09 20:46:00 Z
Summary Text: In our mission to bring together communities, partners, collaborators,
  and supporters of humanitarian open mapping, HOT is trialling a fresh approach to
  conferences in 2022.
---

Instead of hosting our usual HOT Summit conference, we are [investing time and resources](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/) in supporting global, regional, and local conferences and community events around the world to bring humanitarian open mapping to thousands of new people. We have called this the “HOT unSummit,” and we wanted to share our experience and learnings at the halfway point of the ‘world tour’!

Before we start, everyone at HOT and the regional Open Mapping Hubs would like to say a huge thank you to all the organisers, scholars, attendees, volunteers and staff that have contributed to any of the events discussed below. Any success we have seen through the unSummit programme is shared with this diverse group of brilliant people!

## State of the Map 2022, Florence, Italy
How did we contribute / collaborate?
* 11 community members funded to attend
* 10 community members + 3 HOT staff members volunteered for a combined 64 hours
* Hosted a half day, community-led session focusing on OSM for humanitarian purposes
* Hosted a social event for 100 SotM attendees on World Humanitarian Day
* Provided bronze level sponsorship ($2,000)

> **“I had a unique opportunity to learn even more about OpenStreetMap and show a little more of my work, know what is being discussed for the future of OSM and mapping see how the community is really great and welcoming made me feel I was in family and that despite having some differences in the end we are all mappers.”** - Gustavo Soares, mapper / HOT unSummit scholar, Brazil, from his [OSM Diary](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/PlayzinhoAgro/diary/399862)

## FOSS4G 2022, Florence, Italy
How did we contribute / collaborate?
* 11 community members funded to attend
* 9 community members + 3 HOT staff members volunteered a combined 240 hours
* Hosted a hot_tech workshop, a mapathon and a data privacy in humanitarian sessions workshop
* Sponsored the Geochicas networking event at FOSS4G ($300)

> **“On having HOT as part of the event… HOT shares the same ideals as the OSM and OSGeo communities, and many members share at least one other community. It seems to me that having all the conferences together helped more people to attend them (especially people coming from low-middle income countries where flights are usually more expensive)”** - Luca Delucchi, FOSS4G organising committee lead, Italy
