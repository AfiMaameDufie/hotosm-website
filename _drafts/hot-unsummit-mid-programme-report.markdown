Instead of hosting our usual HOT Summit conference, we are [investing time and resources](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/) in supporting global, regional, and local conferences and community events around the world to bring humanitarian open mapping to thousands of new people. We have called this the “HOT unSummit,” and we wanted to share our experience and learnings at the halfway point of the ‘world tour’!

Before we start, everyone at HOT and the regional Open Mapping Hubs would like to say a huge thank you to all the organisers, scholars, attendees, volunteers and staff that have contributed to any of the events discussed below. Any success we have seen through the unSummit programme is shared with this diverse group of brilliant people!
