<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Open and accessible</th>
		<th>Useful and usable data</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>What this means:</b>
Contribute to and advocate for open data, first and foremost OpenStreetMap, and enable anyone to make effective use of this data.
		</td>
		<td><b>What this means:</b>
Collected and contributed OSM data should meet a purpose that’s well defined and described, and conform to given data quality standards so it can be understood, used, and re-used within and outside of HOT’s Impact Areas.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>What we do:</b>
Contribute data to open data sources. First and foremost to OpenStreetMap under the ODbL - the license selected for OSM data which allows free sharing, use, and adaptation.
Ensure (re)usability of data we contribute to OSM by providing ample documentation and metadata.
Advocate and push for open, ODbL compatible, licensing of existing datasets from partners.
Provide easy ways of accessing and using OSM data for a variety of users, and explain how OSM data can be used and incorporated.
Make data available in easy to understand and use formats - including digital formats and platforms (HDX), mobile applications, and paper maps.
		</td>
		<td><b>What we do:</b>
Be deliberate in what data we collect and generate and for what purposes, and align this with the pathways to impactful use of data.
Align data collection and mapping with the priorities of communities and partners.
Improve the quality of OSM data and tagging schemas and standardization, including localization and contextualization.
Ensure we follow OSM guidelines and procedures, such as organized editing, and import processes.
Provide technical resources and services, support, and case studies (including measurement of the usability of data) for Impact areas use cases.

		<th>Inclusive and representative</th>
		<th>Ethical data and protection</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>What this means:</b>
Ensure communities at all levels can access and work in the OSM ecosystem by how HOT prioritizes, creates, and structures data collection, tech, and community resources.
		</td>
		<td>$<b>What this means:</b>
Go for the most meaningful collaboration in data management and planning. Uphold policies and guidance to minimize risk of harms, including impact assessments and informed consent for any data collection or use, based on the people and communities we work with.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>What we do:</b>
When creating mapping tasks, consider who and what we’re including, and who we’re omitting by how we define the area of impact and the data models.
Design, create, promote, and use technology and tools that are accessible and usable. Give specific attention to more vulnerable and/or minority groups to reduce barriers to access.
Commit to reduce inequities to contribution and participation before, during, and after mapping - such as access to devices, mobile data, digital and map literacy, opportunities and economic viability of volunteering time, etc.
Prioritize localization and accessibility of tools, documentation, and tech by providing multiple relevant languages.
		</td>
		<td><b>What we do:</b>
Apply a workable process of engagement and informed consent across our activities, including for remote sensing and digitization (while accounting for an ever more sophisticated technological landscape).
Ensure respect for the beliefs, cultures, lifestyles, and choices of communities in the decision making around data collection and sharing, and in our use of collected information. Engage partners in the ethical use of information.
Conduct risk and data impact assessments to assess and minimize risk of harm for all projects together with the relevant communities. In situations where conflict is a factor, follow the “Conflict zones mapping policy”.
Ensure everyone at HOT is compliant with the application of data and protection principles.
