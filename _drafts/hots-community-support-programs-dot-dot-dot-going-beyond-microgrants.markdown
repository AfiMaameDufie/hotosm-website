Summary Text: "[HOT’s Audacious Vision](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/audacious/)
  is to map an area home to one billion people living in poverty and at high risk
  of disasters by engaging mappers around the world to massively grow the number of
  local edits to the map. To kickstart planning, HOT’s Community Team has hosted a
  series of workshops to understand community perspectives."

Working with and supporting OpenStreetMap communities in 94 Low- and Middle-Income Countries worldwide is critical to [HOT’s Audacious Vision](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/audacious/). Since 2017, [HOT’s Microgrant Program](https://www.hotosm.org/community/community-grants/) has supported 39 communities in 23 countries with grants between $2,000 and $12,000. To date, HOT Micrograntees have made 9 million map edits and trained 13,400 new mappers to join their communities. Now, with the support of the [Audacious Project](https://audaciousproject.org/ideas/2020/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team), HOT will be massively increasing its support to mapping communities to further enable them to grow and contribute high quality data to OpenStreetMap.
