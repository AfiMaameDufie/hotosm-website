Held every 13th of October, the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction aims to raise awareness on what people and communities are doing in order to lessen their risk to disasters. In this monthly update, HOT Philippines shares more of what happens on field for PhilAWARE, a disaster risk reduction project.

**Coordinating with LGUs**

Before teams could proceed with any activity, HOT must first meet with local government units (LGUs) in each municipality. Each municipality has several barangays led by an even more localized council. Our Country Manager, Bry Damasco, and Community and Volunteer Manager, Joji Bonilla, are in charge of coordinating schedules with LGUs.

Most of the coordination is done remotely, but in some cases, the team meets with LGUs to personally provide a detailed explanation of the PhilAWARE project. This month, the team is coordinating a follow-up meeting with the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and tribe leaders in Pampanga to ask permission on mapping ancestral land.

Field movement during a pandemic is not without challenge. On different occasions, confirmed schedules had to be put on hold because certain areas are implementing localized lockdowns due to COVID-19. The team adjusts by coordinating new schedules so the field team could proceed as safely as possible.

**Field and Remote Trainings**

This month, HOT Philippines conducted OSM and field mapping trainings for six local government units: San Simon (October 1-2), Mexico (October 6-7), Sasmuan (October 13-14), Masantol (October 22-23), Macabebe (October 22-23), and Santo Tomas (October 22-23).

On days when scheduled field trainings overlap, both our Training Manager, Sen Roxas, and Data Validation Lead, Honey Fombuena, head the trainings. Aside from field trainings, HOT Philippines also conducted remote mapping trainings for German Red Cross volunteers on October 6, 8, and 9.

**Field Mapping and Data Collection**

As of writing, the field mapping team is mapping Lubao, their sixth scheduled municipality in Pampanga. On October 22, 2020 the team collected field data for critical lifeline infrastructures in three barangays near the Pampanga River.

In heavily populated and building-dense areas, collecting data for for critical lifeline infrastructures alone can be time-consuming, but understandably so, as the team values accuracy. “Halos buong araw nilakad namin ’tong daan dati kasi sobrang daming puwedeng ilagay \[na data\], (We walked this road for almost a whole day before since there’s so much data we could gather), the team shares in transit as our service vehicle runs through a long stretch of road on the way to the riverbank.

Aimon Pangan, one of our Data Validation Leads, details their increased efforts and their standardized procedure to collect field data faster. “Pupuntahan namin ‘yung barangay hall tapos itatanong namin kung saan o paano madaling puntahan ‘yung \[critical lifeline\] infrastructures sa listahan. Pagkatapos, sasamahan na nila kami para madali.” (We go to the barangay hall to ask where and how to locate critical lifeline infrastructures on the list. Then, the locals come with us so it’s easier.)

Aside from collecting field data for PhilAWARE, HOT Philippines is also helping out with the OSMaPaaralan project by supplying data and validating schools in Pampanga. Some of the added information include whether or not schools are used as evacuation centers.

**Partnerships and Other Activities**

Aside from field work, HOT Philippines is also entertaining partnerships with organizations in the Philippines. With the help of Adityo and Tri from HOT Indonesia, HOT Philippines held a Road Mapping Event with MMC. The team is also building a network with AUDEO and the Philippine Coalition for Volunteerism, and we recently confirmed an event media partnership with UP Babaylan - Clark Chapter.
