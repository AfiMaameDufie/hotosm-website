Summary Text: Another year, another Data Quality Internship!
---

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s (HOT) Data Quality Internship has been an annual program since 2020. The 2022 Data Quality Internship (DQI) years program will host 27 interns from 18 countries, and will build on the successes and lessons learned from past programs. 

This year’s DQI aims to: 
* Build trust and transparency in OSM data 
* Build capacity across our validator networks in <HOT’s focus countries>
* Provide learning opportunities for mappers wanting to take their mapping skills to the next level
* Contribute to building a sustainable community of OSM Validators  to ensure continuity of data flow and maintenance in OSM
* Contribute to diversifying our existing network of valued validators
* Prioritize validation of already existing projects on HOT’s Tasking Manager

This year we had an incredible 1008 applications from 81 countries. Of the applicants, 38% identified as a woman, 59% identified as a man, 1% as non-binary and 2% preferred not to say.

Through a rigorous recruitment process, supported by HOT’s HR team - the DQI Coordination Committee selected applicants for interview, with the intention of selecting 30 interns from October - December 2022. 

## Introducing DQI Interns

**Daniel Osei Agyeman**

My name is Daniel Osei Agyeman, and I’ve been a young mapper since 2016. During the GIS celebration day in 2016, I joined YouthMappers while in level 200 at the University of Cape Coast. Since the day I learned how to map with JOSM, I’ve been an active mapper. I’ve worked remotely on a few projects, including 390 tasks on COVID-19 - Yelimane Cercle 4 - Kayes Region, Mali and 136 on Missing Maps: Zimbabwe Malaria Elimination 8. Professionally, I have mapped areas both internationally and in Ghana. I’ve mapped a number of locations in the Northern, Central, and Greater Accra regions.

While working on various field projects in Ghana, particularly in the north, I became acutely aware of the use of the data that we generate remotely, as well as the difficulties that arise when such data is of poor quality. I am inspired to participate in this internship in order to obtain more information and abilities to help me generate more quality data to help both on-field and off-field professionals in their area of work. Also, the fact that I can share the information I receive here with my local youth mappers chapter so that we can continue to develop quality data to be utilized to tackle challenges in our society.

Sangeeta B.C.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Geomatics Engineering at the Paschimanchal Campus in Pokhara. I am the current secretary of the Geomatics Engineering Students Association of Nepal (GESAN). Regarding my OSM journey, I initially heard about OSM during my first semester. After learning about the diverse applications of mapping, I was inspired to get involved. I am currently an Advanced OSM mapper, and have participated in numerous OSM events. I am also a champion of the SLSI program. I am motivated to participate in this excellent opportunity to learn more about OSM and to learn how to provide quality data for humanitarian purposes.

Japhet Masunzu

OSM contributor since 2020

My Professional  mapping experience 

Import and digitization of buildings in DRC

Collection of cartographic data of boundaries and health structures in the territory of Beni, their integration on the Osm server and quality control of these data integrated on the server (Tools: OsmAnd, Osmtraker, JOSM)

Digitization of roads in North Kivu

Participation in Africa Mapathon mapping sessions (Liberia; Lesotho; Morocco)

Assistant trainer in two training workshops on the tools of collection, processing of cartographic data and production of maps organized by OSM DRC

Through this program I would like to improve my knowledge of OpenStreetMap data validation and quality control tools and share this knowledge with other contributors so that together we can contribute to the quality of OSM data and it can be used effectively for community development.

Eray Öztürk

I joined my mapping life at a Missing Map event in 2017. I just started mapping with the OSM id Editor. I didn’t do much mapping until I met the Yer Çizenler Mapping for Everyone Association. They taught me about the usage and detail of OpenStreetMap. After a period of time, I volunteered with them and participated in their activities. I participated in the Mapping Unmapped towns in Turkey event with Yer Çizenler and Youth Season. I participated in natural hazard, disaster, and open data studies in partnership with Friedrich-Naumann Foundation, TESEV and Yer Çizenler. Also, I am currently actively mapping on OpenStreetMap.

The reason I joined this program is so that I can now learn more with open data (JOSM etc.). I will be able to help people who need help, even from a distance, as much as I can.

Shabani Magawila 

Shabani Magawila used to be the president of IRDP YouthMappers in Mwanza and supervisor at IRDP YouthMappers in Dodoma. He graduated from IRDP with a Bachelor’s Degree in Urban Development and Environmental Management. He has been volunteering for OpenStreetMap and YouthMappers since 2017, including through projects like Ramani Huria as Junior Supervisor, WomenConnect as Validator and GIS Analyst and Mnadani Community Mapping as Project Leader. 

Shabani is self-motivated, using GIS and Remote Sensing to help urban, marine, and environmental planners to better plan; and is excited to work with the community and other stakeholders to ensure improved quality of life for both rural and urban residents.

Manish Adhikari

I’m Manish Adhikari, currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Geomatics Engineering at Paschimanchal Campus, Pokhara. I started my OSM journey with the inspiration from great mappers of GESAN, WRC. I just used to map for fun at mapathons. Then I learned many new things that OSM can play an important role for, such as humanitarian activities, emergency preparedness, project data and many more. Now I’m an Advanced level mapper and have already participated in many mapping projects all over world. I also have a little experience as a trainer for beginner level mappers. I want to expand my mapping skill more, and this internship will be great opportunity for me to reach many milestones in quality mapping and data analysis.
