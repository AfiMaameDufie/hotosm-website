**Daniel Osei Agyeman**

My name is Daniel Osei Agyeman, and I’ve been a young mapper since 2016. During the GIS celebration day in 2016, I joined YouthMappers while in level 200 at the University of Cape Coast. Since the day I learned how to map with JOSM, I’ve been an active mapper. I’ve worked remotely on a few projects, including 390 tasks on COVID-19 - Yelimane Cercle 4 - Kayes Region, Mali and 136 on Missing Maps: Zimbabwe Malaria Elimination 8. Professionally, I have mapped areas both internationally and in Ghana. I’ve mapped a number of locations in the Northern, Central, and Greater Accra regions.

While working on various field projects in Ghana, particularly in the north, I became acutely aware of the use of the data that we generate remotely, as well as the difficulties that arise when such data is of poor quality. I am inspired to participate in this internship in order to obtain more information and abilities to help me generate more quality data to help both on-field and off-field professionals in their area of work. Also, the fact that I can share the information I receive here with my local youth mappers chapter so that we can continue to develop quality data to be utilized to tackle challenges in our society.

**Eray Öztürk**

I joined my mapping life at a Missing Map event in 2017. I just started mapping with the OSM id Editor. I didn’t do much mapping until I met the Yer Çizenler Mapping for Everyone Association. They taught me about the usage and detail of OpenStreetMap. After a period of time, I volunteered with them and participated in their activities. I participated in the Mapping Unmapped towns in Turkey event with Yer Çizenler and Youth Season. I participated in natural hazard, disaster, and open data studies in partnership with Friedrich-Naumann Foundation, TESEV and Yer Çizenler. Also, I am currently actively mapping on OpenStreetMap.

The reason I joined this program is so that I can now learn more with open data (JOSM etc.). I will be able to help people who need help, even from a distance, as much as I can.

**Supath Dhital**

Being a geospatial data enthusiast, I am a self-motivated mapper and have more than 2 years of open data experience. Working as a remote mapper at Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) for numerous national and international projects and continuously volunteering from my side, as well as engaging in many webinars and training others in basic mapping, help me boost my knowledge in mapping.

Promoting the open data, delivering the quality data to the users and by learning the tools and techniques from internship and flow this experience to the new digital volunteers and making quality assured and building a self-motivated community motivated me to join the program. 

**Gorakh Nath Pandey**

Over the course of my OSM journey, I have participated in numerous projects that are relevant to OSM. My professional development has been aided by the training I’ve both received and provided. I participated in the UN mapping training on “OpenStreetMap and humanitarian mapping” as one of the mappers. I was motivated to undertake this internship because I wanted to enhance my mapping profession and spread my knowledge more widely. In order to ensure data quality in the mapping field and to provide more spatial data, I was very inspired to join this program as OSM is most vital for geospatial, disaster response, sustainable communities, and several other significant projects.

**Ssekitoleko Derick**

Ssekitoleko Derick is a Humanitarian Digital Disaster Responder. He responds to disasters through mapping while creating free Data for humanitarian Organizations. After four years working as a volunteer mapper and validator with OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team, he realized that data produced by beginner mappers is not of a high quality yet. He believes higher quality data is important and needed for better planning. That’s why he decided to apply for the Data Quality Internship program: to gain more skills in providing higher quality data.

He also believes that free higher quality data is one of the fundamental tools in better planning and development; most especially in developing countries like his country of Uganda, where such data is still missing.

**Anisa Dhakal**

I was made familiar with OSM platform in my first year of Bachelor Degree of Geomatics Engineering through ‘Youth Mapper University Chapter GESAN’. Then, I made my OSM profile on May 13th 2020.

I mapped some of my village area through ID editor. But when my friend introduced me to the HOT Tasking Manager platform and use of JOSM, I was really happy to know that my contributions of mapping were soon utilized for different humanitarian and development purposes through various active and urgent projects. While mapping in my initial year, I had trouble with the tools and plugin and even some technical problem with my updating of works. Then I consulted with my friends and searched for solutions. The more I had to tackle with problem, the more I became interested in it. Still, I am learning to be skilled in mapping and trying to learn some validation skills.

Till now I have contributed to various active projects through the HOT Tasking Manager. I have participated in ‘Field Mapping Tools Workshop’ organized by Open Pacific Hub, ‘Empowering Women In Geospatial Informationen Technology-2022 edition’ by SERVIR Hindu Kush, where I learned about Q-GIS and Remote Sensing. Recently, I had contributed to Remote Mapping Kakamega, Kenya for Transportation Needs Assessment.

**Pragya Pant**

I am Pragya Pant, HOT data quality intern for 2022. I recently graduated as a Geomatics Engineer from Kathmandu University, Nepal. I have worked as a project manager, co-mapathon analyst & field participant in the projects under Booster Grant and HOT Micro-grant along with remotely mapping different countries. I recently completed a 6 months training “She Leads & She Inspires” program. When I started to map it was just for fun but now that I know the value of OSM data and its impacts I am much more concerned about its quality and this motivated me to join the program.

**Odulana Oluwatoyin**

Participation in mapathons and trainings have developed my knowledge in Contributing to the OpenStreetMap. Some of my mapping contributions to OpenStreetMap include participation in the Nigeria SE4ALL remote mapathon, Imagery4socialgood, and the United Nations Mappers training organized in partnership with the university of Lagos on the use of open street map and humanitarian mapping. My motivation for joining this program is to gain advanced hands-on-practical experience with the use of OSM tools, learn more about validation, and contribute quality data to open street map. Also, to further impact individuals who are eager to learn and contribute to OpenStreetMap.

**Anna Lena Fricke**

I started mapping as a complete novice in 2020, when many Mapathons went online after the pandemic hit, and a friend recommended Missing Maps to me. I learned to use first iD Editor and then JOSM at Mapathons and later went to a validator training. Now I am a HOT global validator trainee. I hope to spread the idea of (good) mapping further. A nice cup of tea is always a necessity when I’m mapping or validating!

**Jaqueline Amorim**

I have been mapping geostatistical data with Qgis for 10 years. I started using OpenStreetMap one year ago, when I met other mappers who were using collaborative mapping, and I soon joined the Mapeadores Livres UFPR group, a chapter of YouthMappers. Our group trains and capacitates mappers through courses and activities. In this internship program I want to learn tools to use in humanitarian mapping, so that I can help more people in vulnerable situations in my country, and be able to teach others to use these new tools. I also want to meet people who work with social causes.

**Kokou Elolo AMEGAYIBO**

I am Kokou Elolo AMEGAYIBO alias AKE Amazan, Togolese citizen. I work as a Web/GIS developer and aspiring data analyst with a passion for cartography. An OpenStreetMap contributor since 2013, I am one of the leads of the OSM community in Togo. My hobby projects consist in training new members on OSM but also in contributing to the translation of the project’s tools, Applications and resources in French to make them accessible to the French-only speaking community. I’ m very excited to join this cohort to learn more about the quality assurance tools of OSM and share my field experiences with my peers.

**Dhivya shanmugarajah**

I am Dhivya, from Sri Lanka. I have completed my BSc. (Hons) in Town & Country Planning at the University of Moratuwa. After my graduation, I worked as a GIS assistant in the World bank funded project under the ministry of irrigation. Because of the academic & work experience I had a passion and interest in the field of GIS & Data collection. Then I completed MSC in GIS & Remote Sensing at the University of Sri Jeyawardhanapura. While completing my MSC, I got to know about OSM. As the town planner & the GIS user I know the value of the data. OSM is an open data source where anyone can contribute and download the data. After my pregnancy I was at home for a long. In that time, I have contributed myself to the OSM and I have involved with OSM society. It has become very interesting. I created the great OSM profile, I am also an active in the OSM Sri Lankan community.

I strongly believe that OSM encourages women participation. Even though anyone can contribute to the OSM I always think about the data quality. So I wanted to learn and develop new skills in OSM. At the time, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) had a call for applications for the HOT Data Quality Internship. So I applied.  

**Anil Basnet**

Anil Basnet, a student of Geoinformatics, is a resident of Tulsipur city of Dang, Nepal. He is a regular contributor to OSM and has more than 1250 days of mapping. He has great interest, passion and willpower to serve the community as well as inspire others. His work experience, academic qualifications, and his traits further stimulate him to work for the betterment of the community and utilize his knowledge for humanitarian purposes. 

This time, as a HOT data quality intern, Anil is really excited to learn new skills for proper mapping and validation to create the geospatial data with greater accuracy so that it can be used for data-based decision making in every sector to achieve sustainable development. He is looking forward to connecting with different mapping experts from the international humanitarian open mapping community as well as exchanging experiences with other interns during the internship period.

**Angela Naluonde**

I am a final-year student at Copperbelt University pursuing a BSc in Urban and Regional Planning. Since I started contributing to OSM a year ago, I have primarily mapped buildings, roads, and validation for the Zambia Local Impact Governance project. Nevertheless, I enrolled in the program because I am aware of how crucial data quality is to many projects and initiatives that have an impact either directly or indirectly. To produce correct data for upcoming plans and projects, as well as to share with my community, it is crucial that I learn about data quality.

**Mark Jerome Bongalon**

My mapping journey began in 2016. I started as a volunteer of Project NOAH – a disaster risk reduction and management program of the Philippine Government. Through its risk mapping initiative, I was engaged in OSM tracing of building footprints in some provinces of our country. Even though the project was phased out last 2017, I continued to contribute to other initiatives that utilize and improve on OpenStreetMap data. Some of these are UnmappedPH and OSMaPaaralan. With this and driven by my interest in carrying out humanitarian mapping focused on Disaster Preparedness and Response, I was motivated to join the program.

Jennifer Murray

All things geospatial are what make my world go round! I have a MSc degree in GIS and Remote Sensing and experience as a freelance cartographer and researcher. I am an avid OpenStreetMapper with almost one thousand edits and love to volunteer on HOT projects in my spare time. I strongly resonate with the mission and values of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team to use geospatial data for good and map areas that need it most. HOT’s Data Quality Internship program will allow me to put my passion for mapping to good use, advance my skills and learn more about their projects.

**Keren Wangombe**

I learned about OpenStreetMap during the epidemic and signed up for a workshop hosted by the OSM Kenya community. Since then, I’ve been interested in and active with OSM tools and resources. I had the chance to apply what I’d learned in training to a mapping project for HOTOSM earlier this year. As I worked on the project, I gained knowledge and experience in mapping with OSM tools. My motivation for joining this program is to learn more about the world outside of mapping and find ways to apply my knowledge and education in other contexts.

**Quang Huy NGUYEN**

I am a student in Politecnico di Milano majoring in Landscape Architecture, Urbanism, and Regional Planning. I have interests in GIS, Open Mapping, Volunteered geographic information, Landscape and Urban Analyst, Data Visualization and Cartography. I love participating in workshops, research and community activities. I am also a member of OpenStreetMap Vietnam and Polimapper. I am always curious about data quality, especially geospatial data quality. I hope that during my internship, I could have a clearer view on the good quality of OSM Data and how we can enhance the existing one.

## About the Program

Data Quality Interns will be trained on how to validate projects using the HOT Tasking Manager. We aim to validate 90 projects in the three month long program. Training opportunities will include quality assurance and quality control and will include the usage of a range of open source tools. HOT’s [Data Principals](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/data-principles/) will be used to communicate the importance of data quality and its maintenance. 

To ensure continued engagement with HOT’s validation community and data quality activities, we are working to evolve a sustainability model at the end of the program - more to come on this in the coming months!

We would like to extend our thanks to [MSF](https://www.msf.org/) for the sponsorship of 4 of the interns.
