Summary Text: Another year, another Data Quality Internship!
---

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s (HOT) Data Quality Internship has been an annual program since 2020. The 2022 Data Quality Internship (DQI) years program will host 27 interns from 18 countries, and will build on the successes and lessons learned from past programs. 

This year’s DQI aims to: 
* Build trust and transparency in OSM data 
* Build capacity across our validator networks in <HOT’s focus countries>
* Provide learning opportunities for mappers wanting to take their mapping skills to the next level
* Contribute to building a sustainable community of OSM Validators  to ensure continuity of data flow and maintenance in OSM
* Contribute to diversifying our existing network of valued validators
* Prioritize validation of already existing projects on HOT’s Tasking Manager

This year we had an incredible 1008 applications from 81 countries. Of the applicants, 38% identified as a woman, 59% identified as a man, 1% as non-binary and 2% preferred not to say.

**Daniel Osei Agyeman**

My name is Daniel Osei Agyeman, and I’ve been a young mapper since 2016. During the GIS celebration day in 2016, I joined YouthMappers while in level 200 at the University of Cape Coast. Since the day I learned how to map with JOSM, I’ve been an active mapper. I’ve worked remotely on a few projects, including 390 tasks on COVID-19 - Yelimane Cercle 4 - Kayes Region, Mali and 136 on Missing Maps: Zimbabwe Malaria Elimination 8. Professionally, I have mapped areas both internationally and in Ghana. I’ve mapped a number of locations in the Northern, Central, and Greater Accra regions.

While working on various field projects in Ghana, particularly in the north, I became acutely aware of the use of the data that we generate remotely, as well as the difficulties that arise when such data is of poor quality. I am inspired to participate in this internship in order to obtain more information and abilities to help me generate more quality data to help both on-field and off-field professionals in their area of work. Also, the fact that I can share the information I receive here with my local youth mappers chapter so that we can continue to develop quality data to be utilized to tackle challenges in our society.
