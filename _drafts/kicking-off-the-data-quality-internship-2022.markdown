The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s (HOT) Data Quality Internship has been an annual program since 2020. The 2022 Data Quality Internship (DQI) years program will host 27 interns from 18 countries, and will build on the successes and lessons learned from past programs. 

This year’s DQI aims to: 
* Build trust and transparency in OSM data 
* Build capacity across our validator networks in <HOT’s focus countries>
* Provide learning opportunities for mappers wanting to take their mapping skills to the next level
* Contribute to building a sustainable community of OSM Validators  to ensure continuity of data flow and maintenance in OSM
* Contribute to diversifying our existing network of valued validators
* Prioritize validation of already existing projects on HOT’s Tasking Manager
