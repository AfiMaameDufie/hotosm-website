Over the past few months, we [shared articles documenting the progress of the PhilAWARE project](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/data-driven-disaster-risk-management-philaware/). A collaboration with the USAID and the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) launched in July 2019, PhilAWARE is described as a custom hazard monitoring and early warning system to improve disaster management and decision making in the Philippines.  Supported by PetaBencana.id, PhilAWARE is supposed to equip the Philippines’ National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) with a hazard monitoring, early warning, and decision support tool.

HOT Philippines is a key partner in the PhilAWARE project—tasked to fill the gaps in the critical geospatial data needed for DRRM by collecting local geospatial information including neighborhood boundary information, and transportation and critical lifeline assets such as hospitals, schools, police, and fire stations.

Throughout the project duration, HOT Philippines focused on remote mapping, OSM training, and field mapping. In March 2021, the HOT Philippines field mapping team has completed the field work required by the donors, and are currently presenting the output maps to the local government units (LGUs; concerned municipalities or cities).

## Field Mapping and Training Completion

Field work was carried out in the province of Pampanga. 

* 18/22 municipalities trained: 

* 13/18 municipalities mapped: 

* 4 cities/municipalities unable to commit due to the COVID-19 situation: 

## **Map and Methodology Presentation to Stakeholders**

Following the completion of field work, the field mapping team spent the rest of March 2021 cleaning the data and preparing for the map and methodology presentation to stakeholders. The goal of the presentation is to share the project's progress and map data with the LGUs, and help them locate resources for mapping and training initiatives.

Two output maps are presented to each LGU: one that shows the map data over imagery, and one that highlights the locations of POIs and other elements in the map key. Above is an example of an output map for one municipality in Pampanga: Santo Tomas. 13 pairs of output maps will be presented to the stakeholders.

As of writing, three presentations have been completed. The series of stakeholder meetings are still being coordinated. Since strict lockdowns in the Philippines have been imposed again, the presentations and sharing of resources are done online.

## Creation of the e-Learning Platform

In order to remotely support trainings of local government units (LGUs) and other stakeholders, HOT Philippines is working on an e-Learning platform. Topics covered in the platform include introductions to HOT and OSM, using the Tasking Manager, Data Validation, and downloading OSM data. The topics are introduced in chapters, with learning videos, instructional text and GIFs, and evaluations or quizzes. The platform is hosted by PDC, and will soon be accessible to stakeholders.
