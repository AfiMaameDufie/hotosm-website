As [shared previously](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/), HOT will not host our regular annual [HOT Summit conference](https://summit.hotosm.org/) in 2022. Instead we want to experiment with using the Summit resources to invest in collaborations with existing community events and conferences and bringing the spirit and humanitarian open mapping focus of the HOT Summit to new places and new people across the world.

Through our networks and existing relationships and collaborations, we are already in touch with organizing teams of events we would love to collaborate on, but we are also aware that there are likely many events that we aren’t aware of that could be great opportunities for collaboration and support!

Today we are launching an open call to try and connect with people who are interested in a collaboration with HOT and who are organizing events that meet some basic criteria (see below). If this is you, please get in touch before the end of May so we can start a conversation!

**What type of collaboration are we looking for?**

Depending on the event (and acknowledging that our resources are finite), we could work together on a range of different aspects of event organizing and implementation, including (but not limited to):

* Co-designing content and knowledge sharing for sessions and tracks around shared key themes

* Co-hosting networking events

* Supporting on specific event aspects, such as editorial processes, scholarship programmes, communications and promotion and logistics management

* Supporting on sponsorship and funding

* Helping to recruit event volunteers

**What will happen next?**

This open call ends on the 31 May, so please get in touch before then! After we receive your contact information, we will get in touch with you to discuss potential collaboration. If, through these discussions, we agree there is good potential overlap, we will check on whether we have the necessary resources in place to follow through. The final decisions on which collaborations we can support will be taken in the HOT Summit Working Group in collaboration with the Community Managers in the Open Mapping Hubs by the end of June.

**Important note!**

Please do remember that we have limited resources for this, which means we also have a limit to the number of events we can collaborate with and what we can offer. Whilst we would love to say yes to any collaboration that provides value across the humanitarian open mapping ecosystem, we might not be able to!

What are the criteria for events we collaborate on?

What are the criteria for events we can collaborate with?

Events we can support and collaborate on need to:

* Be conference-style events. This means:
  *That it is clear when and where the event will take place
  That there is an agenda / call for proposals published that clearly shows what content / type of content will be included
  That there is a team of people that are organising and implementing the event who can be points of contact / collaborators for the HOT Summit Working Group
  That a member of the public should be able to buy / register for a ticket and participate in the event*

* Provide value for communities that HOT supports\*\*
* Have a code of conduct or plans for putting one in place
* Have relevant or overlapping themes or content, covering one or more of the following:
OpenStreetMap data / communities
Open data, community or software
Data for humanitarian / development use
Data for disaster response / resilience / risk reduction

In addition, events that have a regional audience need to be located in a region where an [Open Mapping Hub](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) is active (ideally in a [HOT priority country](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Priority_countries), but necessarily serving community members from priority countries). Events that have a national audience need to be located in a [HOT priority country](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Priority_countries). For international events, we would prefer to support those with a virtual component (meaning increased accessibility for those who cannot travel) or those that commit to openly publishing content after the event is held.

Although we are hugely supportive of any event that enriches the open mapping / OpenStreetMap ecosystem, and especially events in our priority countries, we cannot support mapathons, training sessions or community meetups through this initiative.  Firstly, because the point of [the 2022 distributed HOT Summit experiment](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/) is to test a different way of achieving the HOT Summit’s goals, the events we can support through this need to be conference-style events. Secondly, supporting community meetups, mapathons and trainings is part of our day-to-day work and is the responsibility of our Open Mapping Hubs and HOT’s community team, so please feel free to get in touch any time to discuss your event!
