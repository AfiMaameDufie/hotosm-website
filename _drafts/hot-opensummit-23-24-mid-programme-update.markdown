The HOT OpenSummit encompasses three event categories: conferences, open mapping contributions to third-party events, and community events. The program seeks to extend open mapping's reach, promote open map data awareness, and facilitate collaboration and collective action within the open mapping community. It also aims to bring together communities, partners, collaborators, and supporters to learn, share, and connect.
