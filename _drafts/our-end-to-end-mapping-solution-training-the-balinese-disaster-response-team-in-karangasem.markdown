title: 'Our End-to-End Mapping Solution: Training the Balinese Disaster Response Team
  in Karangasem'
date: 2024-04-23 20:45:00 Z
Summary Text: HOT envisions an ecosystem of open mapping technology that enables everyone,
  and in particular vulnerable communities, to make the right open map data available
  in order to use that to make a positive impact on people’s lives.
---

To work towards that vision, HOT’s Tech & Data team have for the past years been working jointly with volunteers and partners on closing key gaps in the open mapping ecosystem. 
Our individual tools have been gradually evolving and are today intensively used in most of HOT’s projects and far beyond. 

Apart from building/improving individual tools, our aim is to develop a streamlined, full end-to-end open mapping workflow that is user-friendly and accessible by people living in vulnerable areas. The end-to-end solution allows anyone to access and apply the full mapping workflow: from collecting raw data to generating insights based on the locally collected data.

In March of 2024, HOT’s Tech&Data team ran an end-to-end community mapping exercise with the local office of the BPBD, the disaster management agency in Bali, Indonesia, in the eastern regency of Karangasem.  We made use of many of the tools created and maintained by the HOT’s team and were able to test our full end-to-end solution. And, we were able to train the local disaster management agency to apply our end-to-end solution in areas that are prone to disasters, in particular landslides.

The primary field location was the village of Sega, in Karangasem Regency (Eastern Bali).

Location of the village Sega and the BPBD Karangasem office

Sega is a beautiful location, but quite vulnerable to landslides and other natural disasters, perched on a steep ancient volcanic mountainside and apparently eroding quite quickly. 

HOT has been training the  Karangasem office of the BPBD on the full end-to-end mapping workflow so as to enable them to generate and use data for landslide risk assessment. 

The key steps in the workflow:

STEP 1 - Acquire base & sensor data
We flew a drone to capture recent and high resolution imagery from the village. We used open software (ODM and OAM) to process the raw imagery and shared the imagery as well as the resulting DEM for wider use.
