We are striving to improve the quality of the OpenStreetMap data we create. Several teams at HOT, including the data team, tech team, and regional hubs, are collaborating to develop resources, tools, skill sharing, and community feedback that will provide an avenue for data creators and users to collaborate with each other and improve the quality of OpenStreetMap data.

Data Team:

The data team has been defining the data use cases and the core impact area datasets, data models data quality aspects, and metrics that are key inputs in data quality measurement, availability and analysis workflows.  

There are 3 key categories of data quality factors identified by the HOTâ€™s Data Team:

Semantic Accuracy

Positional Accuracy

Completeness

Tech Team:

The tech team is implementing OpenStreetMap data quality measurement through automation. 

The team is developing a tool that combines data quality metrics, data quality aspects and data models that provide baseline tagging information. The baseline information includes approved tags for the core impact area dataset, primary and secondary attributes that provide a basis for detecting and querying live data quality issues.

The tool will use the defined data quality metrics of bad tag value, missing tags, and incomplete tags to validate and improve data semantic quality aspects of OpenStreetMap data. 

For positional data quality aspects, the team is using the defined metrics of bad geometry, overlaps, duplicates and orphan nodes to validate the geometry of mapped features.

How the tool will look like:

Before uploading, data quality measurement will be available for use in the Tasking Manager, analyzing the mapping and showing issues. Issues can be related to tips about impact.

While uploading (live reporting), As contributors are editing the map and uploading changes to OSM, the tool will provide live quality data to show in the Tasking Manager to the project managers/mappers. 

Regional Hubs:

The Open Mapping Hubs are working on their regional approaches to data quality. These are resourceful writeups that provide information about the definitions of data quality, data quality issues and requirements within the regions, the tools, and also provides open mapping best practices for improving the quality of OpenStreetMap data contribution in their specific regions. 

 The Asia Pacific hub has published their approach  and as one of the ways to implement the approach, they will be activating  a road validation campaign for some of its priority countries.

Coming up next: 

The Data, tech and community teams are collaborating with regional hubs to pull the Global Data Quality Strategy that will act as a guiding reference of how teams across HOT will collaborate for the coordination and implementation of standards for improving the quality of data produced by HOT and community partners.

Stay tuned for the call for public review of the HOT Global Data Quality Strategy soon.
