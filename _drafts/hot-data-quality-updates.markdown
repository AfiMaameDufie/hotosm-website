Several teams at HOT, including the Data Team, the Tech Team, and the regional hubs, are collaborating to develop resources, tools, skill sharing, and community feedback mechanisms that will be avenues for data creators and data users to collaborate to improve OpenStreetMap data quality.

## Data Team:

The HOT Data Team presented the [top 10 data quality issues](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ngumenawesamson/diary/399636) in a [lightning talk](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/sessions/HLTKHD/) at [State of the Map 2022](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/) in Florence. We categorize these data quality issues into three main categories:
* Semantic Accuracy 
* * Tagging
* * Tasking Manager project consistencies
* Positional Accuracy 
* * Spatial offsets 
* * Feature tracing inconsistencies 
* * Logical consistencies of map features
* Completeness 
* * Temporal inconsistencies 
* * Road network inconsistencies 
* * Completeness of health facilities 
* * Completeness of public service data for sustainable communities 
* * Administrative boundaries

The Data Team is also defining use cases and data quality metrics. Measuring data quality starts with identifying core datasets for each of our [impact areas](https://www.hotosm.org/impact-areas/). Examples include highways and health facilities for Public Health, water & sanitation, transportation, and education for Sustainable Cities & Communities, and waterways, buildings, and highways for Disasters & Climate Resilience. 

We then evaluated the use cases and the metrics for assessing the quality of each dataset, enabling us to identify ways of improving data quality.
