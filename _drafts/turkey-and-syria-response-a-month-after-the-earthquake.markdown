Maps are fundamental to the work of disaster response. They show where households at risk are, where essential services like hospitals are, and how responders can reach affected communities. 

But not every community in the world is mapped, and disasters like floods and earthquakes can radically alter the terrain that is mapped in a moment. Mappers came together after the [devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/haiti_) to use satellite imagery to make maps on OpenStreetMap (OSM) that aided the response effort. 

The community that arose from that tragic event has stayed together, and OSM is again serving as an invaluable platform for lifesaving geodata in the aftermath of the Syria-Turkey earthquake of February 2023. 

Much of this data is the result of a [huge solidarity effort from thousands of OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.hotosm.org/disaster-services/turkiye-earthquakes-february-2023-activation/) in both the affected countries and around the world. In a humanitarian response such as this, it is hard for a member of the public to contribute beyond making a financial donation, but data generated by mappers is already in the hands of responders and has an impact on the ground. 

## Road Networks

Earthquakes create extreme challenges for navigation. Internet and cellular networks are damaged or overloaded, and damage to roads and bridges means navigation data from before the quake are suddenly inaccurate. For Ankara surgeon Dr. Ã‡evik working to save lives in communities damaged by the earthquake in the Hattay region, Organic Maps and the OSM data that feeds it were essential for him and his colleagues to get to the people that needed medical attention.
