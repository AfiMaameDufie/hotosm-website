Within the framework of International Women's Day 2023, the Open Mapping Hub of Latin America and the Caribbean jointly organized with the [OpenLabEc](https://openlab.ec/) the conversation called "[Women, Maps and Data](https://openlab.ec/actividad/conversatorio-mujeres-mapas-y-datos#no-back)", which was held on Thursday, March 9.

The event had the participation of a multidisciplinary panel of speakers who, from their different professional experiences, contributed enriching perspectives to the already broad theme of maps and data worked by women. The event was hosted by [Maria Encalada](https://www.derechosdigitales.org/equipo/maria-encalada/) from OpenLabEc.

Below is a brief summary of the interventions carried out:

Ana [presented](https://twitter.com/OpenlabEc/status/1633975580252045313) the project [¿What about us in the streets?](https://diverciudades.com/y-nosotras-en-las-calles/) focused on an analysis of the names of the streets of Quito. The project questions how cities have been built and reflects on the lack of presence of women in their historical memory.

An interesting fact resulting from the analysis carried out is that streets named after women represent only 4% of the total 5,500 km of streets in Quito city.

Karen [spoke](https://twitter.com/OpenlabEc/status/1633979420154245120) of her work as a designer and how the conjunction of design and data allows her to graph in a single [image](https://www.datasketch.co/es/store/p/ladder-of-rights/) the rights that women have obtained, which ones they are working on and what their next goals will be

Then she briefly shared with us other projects focused on products such as [Latam bike paths](https://co.datasketch.store/products/camiseta-ciclorrutas-de-latam), based on maps of bikeways in several Latin American cities, and the one on the cultural agenda.
