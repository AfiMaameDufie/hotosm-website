Within the framework of International Women's Day 2023, the Open Mapping Hub of Latin America and the Caribbean jointly organized with the [OpenLabEc](https://openlab.ec/) the conversation called "[Women, Maps and Data](https://openlab.ec/actividad/conversatorio-mujeres-mapas-y-datos#no-back)", which was held on Thursday, March 9.

The event had the participation of a multidisciplinary panel of speakers who, from their different professional experiences, contributed enriching perspectives to the already broad theme of maps and data worked by women. The event was hosted by [Maria Encalada](https://www.derechosdigitales.org/equipo/maria-encalada/) from OpenLabEc.

Below is a brief summary of the interventions carried out:
