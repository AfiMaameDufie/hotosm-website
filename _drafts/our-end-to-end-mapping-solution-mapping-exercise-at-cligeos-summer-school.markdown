date: 2024-04-30 10:43:00 Z
Summary Text: "This summer school was jointly organized by the Center for Space Science
  and Geomatics Studies (CSSGS) at Tribhuvan University, the University of Udine in
  Italy, and LJ University in India The primary goal was to train participants from
  diverse backgrounds, including students, geospatial professionals, and government
  representatives, on conducting an end-to-end mapping exercise using open-source
  software. We aimed to showcase how these tools can support decisions around climate
  change challenges. With the help of the organizing team and more than 30 participants,
  we were able to carry out the entire end-to-end mapping workflow. \n\n# AREA OF
  INTEREST\n\nThe area for our exercise was the beautiful, diverse perimeter of the
  Agriculture Research Center, located approximately 20 km northwest of Pokhara. This
  area, outlined on OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/742793744), is
  situated in Lumle, a town in the Annapurna Rural Municipality, Kaski District, in
  the Gandaki Zone of northern-central Nepal. Lumle is known for being the highest
  rainfall area in Nepal and relies on its hilly terrain with beautiful views.\n\n<img

In April 2024, we had the opportunity to demonstrate the power of open mapping tools and workflows at the CLImbing for CLImate GEOspatial School (CLIGEOS-2024) in Annapurna-3, Lumle-Pokhara, Nepal.
