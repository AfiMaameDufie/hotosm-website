  Header: What is OpenStreetMap
  Text: OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable world map
    and is at the core of HOT’s mapping activities. You are free to use it for any
    purpose as long as you credit OSM and its contributors. The power of OpenStreetMap
    is that it empowers anyone, anywhere in the world to add information to a collective
    map and use the data for any purpose.

  Header: What is Open Mapping
  Text: Open mapping is a global movement to create free and open geographic data.
    Beyond open data, it is a broad community partnership to collaboratively create
    a critical data resource for monitoring and meeting the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) by making available fundamental, detailed, and timely information
    on where things are in our world.
  Text-alternate: " Open mapping is a global movement to create free and open geographic
    data. Grounded in open source principles and Data Protection. HOT serves as a
    platform that fosters community building, collaboration and development of resources
    to contribute to the movement. At its core is OpenStreetMap (OSM), a crowdsourced
    project to map the world driven by a growing community of mappers.<br> <br> Check
    out the resources available within LearnOSM, to get started on OSM or use the
    many tools available to edit or use the open data.<br> If you are interested in
    contributing or repurposing our tools, you can access all our code, documentation,
    and other resources on GitHub."
