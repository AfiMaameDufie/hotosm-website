Welcome to HOT’s first engineering blog post. 
We will be using this space to share stories from HOT team's Engineering world. 
We have another blog as well, where you can read about general HOT news and project updates.

Our tech blog page will talk about ways in which the engineering team plays a strong role in HOT's mission. 

So you can expect stories around:

- technical challenges we solve;
- general release updates on our products;
- our work culture while being a remote distributed team.

So our audience can get a holistic picture of what it’s like working at HOT.

We are excited to share these stories with you and hear from you. If you are interested in working with us, please visit our jobs page.
