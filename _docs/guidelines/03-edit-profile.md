To update your profile, you have two methods:

1. Edit via Github. You will need a Github account.

2. Edit via Siteleaf. This is our content management tool for content writing and editing.

**BEFORE YOU CAN EDIT:** You need to have an account on Github or a SiteLeaf account (our content management tool for editing). [Follow these instructions first if you want to edit via Siteleaf](/docs/siteleaf/register). For Github, make sure you have an account and then follow the instructions below.

****

### Editing via Github

* Navigate to `https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm-website/tree/gh-pages/_people`

* Select `Edit this file`. This will fork the project into your repo and you'll be able to edit the markdown file directly.
