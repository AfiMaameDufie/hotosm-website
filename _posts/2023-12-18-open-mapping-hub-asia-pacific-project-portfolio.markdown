The Open Mapping Hub Asia-Pacific is thrilled to present our Project Portfolio, a testament to our commitment to **fostering a sustainable OSM ecosystem in the region.**

This portfolio is a testament to the dedication, passion, and collaborative spirit of our mapping community. From our humanitarian action on the ground, mapping disaster services, to impactful booster grants, support to local social enterprises, as well as our dynamic university partnerships forged through student club sponsorship, each page of our project portfolio reflects the collective impact we've made.

This project portfolio has captured the power of collective action through the tireless efforts of our OSM community that have put in numerous hours supporting remote mapping campaigns and on-the-ground initiatives. We extend our deepest gratitude to the communities, partners and individuals for your support in helping us achieve our mission and creating a positive, real-world impact.

Together, we are building a vibrant OSM community in the Asia-Pacific.
