<p align="justify">To continue giving a more complete picture of our activity on the Senegalese ground and our interaction with all types of actors, it’s worth mentioning the mapping party we held in <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louga">Louga</a> the 28-May at the office of a French NGO, the Groupe Energies Renouvelables, Environnement et Solidarités (<a href="http://www.geres.eu">geres</a>) is working in the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferlo">Ferlo</a> region on thematics revolving around resilience to global change. The workshop was organized by Madicke Seck, a Senegalese mapper and the GIS expert of the <a href="http://www.geres.eu">geres</a>. Madicke was introduced to us by Gael from OSM-France who trained him first on OSM earlier in winter time in Montpellier. We worked and achieved a lot with Madicke during our time in Senegal and became friends with him and his family. The mapping party brought together staff from <a href="http://www.geres.eu">geres</a>, civil servants from ARD, AFC and ONF, teachers and individuals interested into OSM, all friends! Again the workshop went well and was seen as a first step towards the longer process of forming an OSM group in Louga to achieve the potential of using OSM within the work of those organizations. Thinking beyond <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louga">Louga</a> towards the valley of the Senegalese River as well as the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferlo">Ferlo</a>, it’s good to realize the linkages that exist between those OSM folks in Louga (one hour driving time from Saint-Louis) and the potential for OSM witnessed and experienced in <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Louis_%28S%E9n%E9gal%29">Saint-Louis</a>. The linkages are there through individuals (Madicke has family that lives in Saint-Louis and <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guediawaye">Guediawaye</a> and his brother, Assane, works with GIS in Saint Louis at the Agence Developpement Communal), through institutions (<a href="http://www.geres.eu">geres</a> and <a href="http://www.ugb.sn/">UGB</a> have a cooperation agreement in place) to form a strong basis of an OSM ecosystem in Northern Senegal.</p>
