<p>Hey kiddoes!</p><p>Brian checking in from Saint-Marc. We are in the final throws of the program here. Hard to believe 3 months is wrapping up. Bananas.</p><p>The team and trainees here has pretty sufficiently mapped the entirety of Saint-Marc. The last week we have been focusing on quality control, and enhancing the data that is already in OSM. Things have been going well with that, the advanced have really stepped up to show their skills. Other than that there has been much council forming and meetings of the active youth members in the forming of COSMHA-STM, which will be the Saint-Marc chapter of the Community OSM Haiti. Appointments and elections have finished, congrats to them. We have also been doing much preparations for the Graduation ceremony tomorrow. Graduations in Haiti are quite a large to do and I look forward to sharing a post about it and some photos about it with yous guys later this week. We will also be presenting ourselves this week at the Fet Patronal festival this week. It is when Saint-Marc celebrates their formation as a commune and it is quite the celebration of music and who's who in Haiti. We will be maintaining a kiosk outside the mayors office for the next two afternoons.</p><p>Please enjoy these pics of the evolution of the map throughout the project:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/2012-01-08_0.png" alt="" style="width:906px;height:618px"></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/2012-02-16_0.png" alt="" style="width:905px;height:620px"></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/2012-03-16_0.png" alt="" style="width:904px;height:618px"></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/2012-04-04_0.png" alt="" style="width:905px;height:618px"></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/2012-04-19_0.png" alt="" style="width:907px;height:619px"></p><p>And of course check out the current map in your future today here: http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=19.10794&amp;lon=-72.70007&amp;zoom=17&amp;layers=M</p>
