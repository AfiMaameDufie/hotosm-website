**What we learned at State of the Map 2022**

At State of the Map in Florence, HOT’s Data team, in collaboration with our Tech team, members of the Quality Assurance & Control working group, Training working group, and HeiGIT, organized several sessions focusing on identifying and addressing data quality issues in OpenStreetMap (OSM). The data quality discussion session was attended by 30 participants, representing diverse interests and organizations. 

The first question we asked the group was to “define data quality” from their perspective in order to understand and to set expectations of the session. The responses in the workshop can roughly be grouped according to four themes:
* Data can be “trusted”
* Data should be “fit for purpose”
* Good enough quality and completeness of data
* Data and geometry features conform to certain technical requirements

These raise a number of follow up questions:
* What does it mean for data to be “fit for purpose”? How do we decide on the purpose of data, and the most urgent and important data uses it needs to be able to satisfy?
* How can we quantify trust in data, and what does this depend on?
* What aspects of quality, such as completeness or positional accuracy, are we prioritizing? Are all datasets equally valuable - and how do we choose among those?
* What data uses really depend on correct geometry and tagging, and which aspects do we need to address most urgently?
