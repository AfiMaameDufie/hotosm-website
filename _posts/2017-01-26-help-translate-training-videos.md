<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At HOT, we want to make sure people can contribute to OpenStreetMap in a number of ways: through mapping, hosting mapathons and validating. And we’d like your help!</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">We have a series of 12 brief, embeddable tutorial videos on our Youtube page on</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;topics such as what is OSM and what is HOT, how to sign up for OSM, how to draw a building or road in iD, how to use the Tasking Manager, how to host a mapathon and a lot more. Most of them are 3 minutes or less, so they’re a quick way to learn and get started&nbsp;—&nbsp;put them in your website, embed in a HOT Task or use them for a training!</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s3"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb9506_-6FMHZ3nwn9heri3xjQKrSq1hN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb9506_-6FMHZ3nwn9heri3xjQKrSq1hN</a></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">And there are subtitles for the videos in English, Spanish and French and now Turkish for some of the videos! To see the subtitles on the videos, click the CC button, then the gear to choose the language.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="p4"><span class="s5">If you'd like to help add subtitles for other languages, or know someone who'd be interested, let us know! We used a free and easy site called&nbsp;<a href="http://amara.org/"><span class="s6">Amara.org</span></a>, which&nbsp;adds the new captions automatically to the videos.&nbsp;</span></p>
