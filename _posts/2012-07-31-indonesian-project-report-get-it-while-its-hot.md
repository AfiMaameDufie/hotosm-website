The gathered information can then be used in QGIS and in “Inasafe,” the risk modelling software program developed by AIFDR and GFDRR, to create scenarios and measure exposure. The report also offers recommendations for improving data collection and resources for Indonesia's initiatives to gather exposure data.</p><p>You can also get further details about the plug-ins developed in response to this project. Like other contributors of OSM tools, HOT has created software to fill gaps in the varying uses of the open source spatial data. Thus far, the project initiated the development of the <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">Tasking Manager</a>, a program that coordinates data collection; and SDS plugin <a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2012-March/024677.html">(details)</a>, or private data storage for information, like household income.</p><p>This&nbsp;<span class="file"><img class="file-icon" title="application/pdf" src="/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png" alt=""> <a title="Report: Community Mapping for Exposure in Indonesia" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/CM4E-Indo-en.pdf">Report: Community Mapping for Exposure in Indonesia</a></span> answers any questions you may have concerning what HOT has been doing in Indonesia, who we are working with and what the future has in store, such as training a team of Indonesian students to teach the workshops.</p><p>Enjoy reading it!</p>
