<p>The World Bank recently released its extensive guide to planning an Open Cities mapping project, which was proudly co-authored by HOT.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar/publication/planning-open-cities-mapping-project" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.opencitiesproject.org/" target="_blank">Open Cities Project</a> began two years ago under the World Bank's <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/" target="_blank">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)</a>, with initial locations in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The aim is to promote open data ecosystems that support disaster risk management in high risk locations.</p><p>Of note in the Open Cities guide (<a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/07/20317775/" target="_blank">available here</a>) is a detailed approach to planning, managing, and reviewing &nbsp;mapping projects in which implementers intend to map a finite area using a specific data model. Using OpenStreetMap as the platform for data collection, the guide explains the methodology of mapping primarily in organizational terms, with less focus on the detailed technical aspects of tools like JOSM and Field Papers. Extensive experience and lessons learned from the first Open Cities projects, as well as HOT activities, will help inform future efforts.</p><p><img class="image-medium" title="Planning an Open Cities Mapping Project" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/medium/public/wb_guide.png?itok=uk8Y2Qde" alt="Planning an Open Cities Mapping Project" style="width:193px;height:250px"></p><p>It's great to see how many variations of OSM mapping projects have emerged in the past years under different auspices and with varying objectives and methodologies. I think Open Cities puts the right focus on one of the core philosophies of all this work, which is to foster buy-in and collaboration among a wide range of actors, as the power and value of open data gains more and more traction.</p><p>This book offers insights and practical knowledge for anyone interested in organizing a large mapping project. I'm pleased that HOT has been able to collaborate on this, especially in being able to combine our experience with the important work of GFDRR. And I look forward to the future development of more and more open mapping activities!</p>
