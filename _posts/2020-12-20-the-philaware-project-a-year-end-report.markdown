## What is PhilAWARE?

2020 has been an impactful year for HOT Philippines as the country team’s flagship project, PhilAWARE, achieved milestones for its pilot areas amidst the pandemic. Launched in July 2019, the PhilAWARE project is a localized version of DisasterAWARE, funded by the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and supported by the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).

### HOT Philippines' Role in the Project

Initially, the HOT Philippines team was tasked to map two pilot areas: the Province of Pampanga, and Quezon City in Metro Manila. This year, remote mapping for both areas were completed, and a new pilot area for remote mapping was added: Marikina City in Metro Manila. Furthermore, despite the pandemic, field data collection has progressed well in Pampanga.

The HOT Philippines team trained local government units and volunteers on how to map (remotely and in the field), analyze data from OpenStreetMap, and integrate the data into the government’s disaster management efforts. Data gathered includes building footprints, road networks, and critical lifeline infrastructures. The building footprints and road networks are mapped remotely through the HOT Tasking Manager using satellite imagery. This data is further improved through the collection of attribute information on the ground during field mapping.

**POI Collection:**

The table below shows the critical lifeline infrastructures (POIs) that were collected, processed, and uploaded by the Pampanga Team in OpenStreetMap as of 18 December. These data were extracted from the Overpass API and are now available for download by the public.

The table below shows the quantity of the added and updated points of interests (POIs) collected during the field mapping activities for each municipality.

**Road Mapping**
