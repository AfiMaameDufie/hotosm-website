Summary Text: HOT is managing a mapping project for malaria eradication across seven
  countries in Southern Africa, Southeast Asia and Central America. This project is
  part of the Missing Maps initiative and is backed by DigitalGlobe, the Clinton Health
  Access Initiative and the Gates Foundation. Our mission is to generate building
  data in OpenStreetMap for a total of over 500,000 square kilometers by April 2017.
  We are starting a YouthMappers competition for the project. Prizes will be given
  to the chapters that contribute the most quality data to this project.
