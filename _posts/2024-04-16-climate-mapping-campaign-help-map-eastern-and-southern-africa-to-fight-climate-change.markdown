That's why we're launching the Climate Mapping Campaign, a critical initiative to empower communities across Eastern and Southern Africa. With the power of Open Street Maps, we aim to create vital data that will be instrumental in supporting preparedness, response, and early recovery efforts for those facing climate-related disasters.

The campaign runs from April 11th to the end of July 2024.

**How it works:**

Together, we will map critical infrastructure (buildings, roads) in vulnerable areas. This data helps disaster response teams plan for faster aid delivery, allocate resources to those most in need, and respond more effectively after disasters.

**Our Focus:**

* Mozambique: Rebuilding after Cyclone Filipo with local communities.
* Zambia: Mapping land use to combat drought with government agencies.
* Kenya: We partnering [CIAT](https://alliancebioversityciat.org/regions/africa/kenya) for climate-smart agriculture solutions.
