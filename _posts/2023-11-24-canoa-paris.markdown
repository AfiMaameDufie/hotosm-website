Throughout its history advocating for socio-environmental rights in the Lower São Francisco region, Canoa de Tolda has engaged in various projects. The Mato da Onça Reserve, focusing on conserving biodiversity in the Caatinga biome, has yielded significant results in the past decade. Ensuring access to the São Francisco River's water and accurate area mapping is crucial for its continuity. Desertification and the control of river waters by hydroelectric companies have negatively impacted the site. Furthermore, private actions destroying protected areas, not adequately represented in official maps, further compromise its integrity. In this context, the partnership with HOT, initiated in 2022, proves essential for the ongoing success of the Mato da Onça Reserve.

The participation of Reserva Mato da Onça in the Paris Peace Forum 2023 marked a significant opportunity to spotlight its endeavors on a global stage. Beyond mere recognition, the forum served as a platform for showcasing the initiative's tangible impacts to influential stakeholders and potential future partners. This international gathering not only elevated the profile of Reserva Mato da Onça but also fostered connections that are integral for its continued success in socio-environmental conservation in the Lower São Francisco region. The event underscored the initiative's commitment to biodiversity preservation in the Caatinga biome, emphasizing the crucial role of strategic partnerships in addressing environmental challenges.\
