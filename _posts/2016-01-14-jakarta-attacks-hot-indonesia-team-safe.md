<p>Today, on the morning of 14 January, there were a number of explosions due to suicide bombers and shooting across the street from the HOT Jakarta office in Menara Thamrin (UN building). All HOT staff are safe and accounted for. The building was locked down for the rest of the day, meaning that those inside remained inside until the end of the day, at which time the Australia embassy graciously provided transport for HOT staff. The office remains closed tomorrow, Friday 15 January. HOT is communicating with our Australian government partners and will advise with any changes to the security situation for our staff.</p>
