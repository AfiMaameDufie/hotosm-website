<p>On a couple of bright, sunny days at the Innovation Centre at Bayview Yards, 105 members of the HOT Community from all across the globe and different sectors came together to share lessons learned, learn new things and discuss the future of mapping. We were able to get quick updates on impact from our Lightening Talks, had time to chat in discussions about pressing issues like ethics in humanitarian mapping, and hear from colleagues and fellow volunteers about mapping from Uganda to Bangladesh to Colombia and many places in between.</p><p>Don't worry if you missed it, we've already started posting videos of sessions on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hotosm">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;and we'll continue to post videos throughout the week, so keep an eye out to rewatch your favorite talk or catch the ones you missed.&nbsp;</p><p>We are always trying to improve and want to make each Summit better than the last. To do that, we need your thoughts, so please take 5 minutes to fill out the survey to share your thoughts and help us make next year the best Summit ever! This is also your chance to put in suggestions for the location of next years's Summit or to join the Summit Working Group and be in on the planning from the beginning. Two lucky Summit survey respondents will receive one of our Summit t-shirts!
