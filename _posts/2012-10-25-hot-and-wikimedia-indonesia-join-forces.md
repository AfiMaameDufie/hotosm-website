Summary Text: 'We met at the National Library of Indonesia-- partly for its space
  and partly for its reference materials. Unlike the English wikipedia, Wedimedia
  Indonesia requires two or more sources per page.  Full articles require sources
  every sentence.  The community of wiki users in Indonesia is small and so they do
  not have the manpower to be constantly editing and administrating all the articles.  Our
  team met up with some administrators of Wikimedia to help them create and edit pages
  on the major roads in Jakarta.  <strong>Who: </strong> John Vandenberg, the President
  at Wikimedia Australia, Wikimedia Indonesia teams and HOT: Indo.  <strong>What:
  </strong> Learning how to edit wiki road pages, upload pictures on wiki commons
  and link these pages to OSM, and other maps.  '
