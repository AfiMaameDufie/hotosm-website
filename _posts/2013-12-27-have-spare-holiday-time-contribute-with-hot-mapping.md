Summary Text: Many of us have spare quiet moments in the Christmas and New Year holiday
  season. We've gorged ourselves on food, cleaned up wripped apart wrapping paper,
  and maybe had a little time to relax and reflect. Now, If you're looking for something
  to occupy your time these days as your energy builds for the new year, you're more
  than welcome to join in and map HOT tasks, and make a solid contribution to places
  in humanitarian crisis right at this moment.

<p>Many of us have spare quiet moments in the Christmas and New Year holiday season. We've gorged ourselves on food, cleaned up wripped apart wrapping paper, and maybe had a little time to relax and reflect. Now, If you're looking for something to occupy your time these days as your energy builds for the new year, you're more than welcome to join in and map <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">HOT tasks</a>,&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">and make a solid contribution to places in humanitarian crisis right at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The intense activity from <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan">Typhoon Haiyan</a> is slowing down, but there's still much to do there, including post disaster assessments and mapping in gaps in our coverage.</span></p>
<p>The<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Central_African_Republic#RCA_crisis_-_HOT_Activation_-_mapping_goals"> Central African Republic </a>conflict is escalating, and in risk of great violence. There are a quite a number of things to do, including tasks, but also data imports.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The conflict situation is changing rapidly in </span><a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_SouthSudan#South_Sudan_crisis_-_HOT_Monitoring_-_mapping_goals">South Sudan</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">. At the moment, we're working in a preparedness mode, mapping locations were incidents are occuring, using Bing imagery. If we are requested to ramp up our activities by partners, this could build into a fuller activation.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">In DRC, we have&nbsp;<a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/job/352">one remaining task</a>&nbsp;to finish up in Kivu region, from our&nbsp;<a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-12-12_hot_activation_south_and_north_kivu_democratic_republic_of_congo">activation last year</a>. Would be excellent to finish up our work there.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">As always, jump in, read up on the situation, and <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">take a task</a>. If you have any questions, or want to contribute in <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/get-involved">more involved ways</a>, get in touch with coordinators listed on wiki pages, or ask on our <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/">mailing list</a> or IRC channel (#hot on irc.oftc.net).</span></p>
