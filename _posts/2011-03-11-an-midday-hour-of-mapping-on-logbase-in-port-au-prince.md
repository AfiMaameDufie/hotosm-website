<p>Erica and I have been in Haiti for almost a week. Inspiring and overwhelming, and lots to talk about. But for this moment, just a small slice of what's going on.</p><p><img title="IMG_0378 by mikel_maron, on Flickr" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/5515425818_92a2363b57.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:375px"></p><p>This is <a href="http://twitter.com/rrbaker">Rob Baker</a> learning to survey with GPS in OpenStreetMap, being taught by Haiti OSM mapper Denny.</p><p>Notice anything unusual? This is the foreign super-connected techie learning the ropes from a citizen of a Haiti that's still struggling to emerge from the earthquake over a year ago.</p><p><img title="Dodane by COSMHA, on Flickr" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/5515709460_328d7096b5.jpg" alt="" style="width:375px;height:500px"></p><p>One thing they mapped is this "Dodane", or speed bump. Perhaps the biggest change I've seen in Haiti this week is the proliferation of speed bumps on Logbase.</p><p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/1195594754">This is that speed bump on OSM</a>. Notice the tag "photo_url" which links to Flickr. Follow that link and notice the link on the lower right hand side back to OSM to "This is a feature in OSM". Photos and maps are linked! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60242340@N04/map/">This is the map of COSMHA's hopefully growing collection of photos in Haiti</a>.</p>
