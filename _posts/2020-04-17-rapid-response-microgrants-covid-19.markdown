Displaced people living in refugee camps or informal settlements, and those with additional vulnerability (e.g. those living with TB or HIV/AIDS) could be at greater risk if they are not formally recognized as a high-risk community.

Living in unmapped areas could mean that these vulnerable communities are left out of lifesaving programs. Right now, it is of the utmost importance that response mechanisms can be effectively planned and disseminated to ensure everyone has access to appropriate healthcare – particularly for testing, treating and tracing the virus. As a direct response to COVID-19, HOT has launched **Rapid Response Microgrants:** **COVID-19.**  

For the Rapid Response Microgrants, funds are designated specifically for: a) remote-based activities; that b) focus on the global COVID-19 pandemic.
