<p>With the support of the ICT Directorate and the Agence Informatique de l’Etat (<a href="http://www.adie.sn/">ADIE</a>), HOT and the Canadian Support Project of the Plan National Géomatique (<a href="http://www.rncan.gc.ca/sciences-terre/a-propos/international/collaboration/4618">PNG</a>) held a one day workshop around OSM at the ADIE office on June 7th.</p><p>The PNG is a project funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (<a href="http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/home">CIDA</a>) to support the Groupe Interinstitutionnel de Concertation et de Coordination en Géomatique (<a href="http://www.en-afrique.info/?plan-national-geomatique-appel-a">GICC</a>) whose Secretariat is chaired by ADIE to build a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for Sénégal. The participation was large: the main GIS actors of the GICC were present. The morning session was largely participated and dedicated to presentation and discussion around OSM and its potential for the PNG with an upper-management audience. In the afternoon, a hands on session brought together a less crowded audience of GIS and IT practitioners around OSM techniques and tools.</p><p>The event raised awareness around OSM and its strong potential for the Senegalese SDI as well as for the various geomatics solutions of the Senegalese Agencies part of the GICC and PNG. It was also great to see the interest for OSM by Maimouna Diop-Diagne, head of the ICT Directorate and in charge of the Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée (SCA) through her continued support during the HOT mission. Here again, relations were built. Overall, relations and the positioning of OSM at the forefront of the GIS and ICT agenda in Senegal look like strong assets for planning and working towards the growth of the OSM project in Senegal.</p><p><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/image004_0_0.jpg?itok=lEBceDSd" alt="" style="width:480px;height:360px"><br><em>Nicolas presenting the HOT – OSM project at ADIE</em></p><p>Nicolas, Stephane and Will</p>
