HOT’s Executive Director, Tyler Radford, has announced his decision to step down at the end of 2022, after leading the organization for seven years.

Since 2015, Tyler has led the team in becoming a trusted ally to communities and partners globally. In 2020, HOT was selected as an awardee of the ### **[Audacious Project]**(https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team) for big, bold solutions. The organization launched [regional Open Mapping Hubs](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) to prioritize community-led action in 2021 and 2022. And earlier this year, HOT completed an inspiring Living Strategy to guide our work in the years ahead. 

HOT’s board of directors sees this current leadership transition as a ***moment of opportunity*** to further embrace our role as a catalyst within the open mapping space. 

The transition will be guided by our **values**:

###*Put people first
###* Collaborate for impact
###* Work in the open
###* Build for inclusivity

### Next Steps:

We will work with an executive search firm to recruit HOT’s next Executive Director and anticipate that a new leader will join the organization in the first half of 2023. In the interim, HOT has appointed Rebecca Firth as Deputy Executive Director. She will serve as Interim Executive Director starting January 3, following Tyler’s departure.  

> Heartfelt thanks again to Tyler for his leadership over the past seven years. We are optimistic about HOT’s future and the opportunities that lie ahead. We look forward to working with the wider community to improve the wellbeing of people and the health of our planet by growing the open mapping movement. 


Kate Chapman
President, Board of Directors
