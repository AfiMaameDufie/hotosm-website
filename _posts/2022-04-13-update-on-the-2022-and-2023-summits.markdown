title: 'HOT Summit: an Exciting New Approach for 2022 and 2023'

Summary Text: We want to improve how we bring communities, partners, and supporters
  together around open mapping, OpenStreetMap, and humanitarian response / social
  impact through the HOT Summit. The last two HOT Summits were online, due to Covid,
  and this has given us the chance to reflect on how to do this. In the next 12 months,
  we will not hold a central HOT Summit, but instead will invest the time, money and
  other resources in supporting and collaborating on a range of community events,
  bringing the spirit of the Summit to multiple new places and hundreds of new people!
  In 2023, we will aim to co-host a full, in-person (or hybrid) HOT Summit with a
  community event in one of HOT’s priority countries.

The purpose of the [HOT Summit](https://summit.hotosm.org/) has always been to bring together communities, partners, collaborators and supporters, committed to and active in HOT’s mission and vision, to learn, share and connect. The event has brought together 100s if not 1000s of people over the years and has been a rich and fertile ground for building capacity, sharing knowledge, strengthening networks and launching collaborations and initiatives around humanitarian work, social impact and OSM and open mapping.

The HOT Summit has always been our flagship event, but we haven’t organized an in-person version since the Audacious funding was announced and HOT’s evolution accelerated. Covid meant that we had to adapt and the Summit went online (and kudos to the Summit WG and all contributors for making this happen!). However, we know that this has its disadvantages as well as its advantages.

Since [the first Summit in 2015](http://summit2015.hotosm.org/), the humanitarian open mapping landscape (communities, NGOs, institutions, government entities, tech collectives as well as knowledge, projects, ways of working, tools) has also evolved and proliferated massively and this is a wonderful thing.

As a consequence of the above, the HOT Summit working group is excited to present a new and experimental approach for the Summit for 2022 and 2023.

For this period, we will focus only on [priority country](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Priority_countries) locations for the HOT Summit as our hypothesis (based on previous experiences, but especially on the [2018 Summit in Dar-es-Salaam](http://summit2018.hotosm.org/)) is that an event in the regions where we are active and want to support impact through OpenStreetMap better serves communities and partners in those regions and maximizes access and value for people living there.

We want to use the Summit, and its associated resources (inc. human, financial and knowledge) as a means to support other events and communities, so we are contributing value across a network, rather than centralizing it in one place.

Over the next 12 months, *we will not host a HOT Summit as we know it*, but will instead experiment with a new approach, developing a programme of collaborations and partnerships with communities, organizations and networks who are already planning events where we can bring, or strengthen, a focus on humanitarian open mapping and OpenStreetMap for social impact.

Our hypothesis is that, through this distributed, networked approach, we can bring the spirit and impact of the HOT Summit to new places and audiences and support the growth of the open humanitarian mapping movement, at the same time as investing in and developing impactful collaborations with a wide variety of communities and organizations at a national, regional and international level.

Next year, however, in 2023, we plan to switch tactics and organize and resource a more traditional, in-person (or hybrid) HOT Summit event, but co-hosted with an existing and relevant community event in one of HOT’s priority countries (building on the success of the 2018 Dar-es-Salaam model). Our hypothesis is that, through a large-scale, co-hosted model with a community event in a priority country, we can have a greater impact on mobilizing a global community of people and groups.

Why are we deciding to do two things?

Our goal is to work out how the efforts of the Summit Working Group, the resources from HOT and the people who generously sponsor the event and the commitment and time of all those people who make the event so rich and vibrant, can be best channeled to continue to deliver on the HOT Summit’s purpose. The Summit WG discussed and voted on several options for the next event and the two models that were prioritized were, first, the co-hosting model and, second, the model that really invests in collaborations with existing community (and other relevant) events.

We researched the event landscape for the coming 12 months and no clear and viable opportunities to co-host were identified, so the WG, with unanimous support from the senior management team, decided to test the two approaches over a two year period. Obviously, this mixed-method approach will require us to be really smart about how we evaluate and learn from the two different models, so insights and data can feed into how we leverage the Summit in the future.

As we go through this period of experimentation and develop these concepts, we plan to engage deeply and communicate regularly on opportunities, developments and news with all those who want to participate and support.

How can you help?

Firstly, if you know of events that might align with HOT’s mission and who would be open for collaboration or support, please let us know via [summit@hotosm.org](mailto:summit@hotosm.org). We are particularly interested in events in priority countries but open to all good suggestions! It is in the community team OKRs to have a programme of events ready to implement by end of June.

Secondly, if you want to get involved in the work of delivering on this ambitious approach, you could consider joining the HOT Summit Working Group (talk to Dana Gallaty), which will remain the engine of the HOT Summit and will be central to all design, coordination and delivery aspects. We particularly need good brains thinking about how we evaluate and learn from these two approaches!

Lastly, if you have comments, questions or suggestions, the Summit WG would love to hear from you! There will be a thread open tomorrow on the Community Working Group forum where you can post and discuss. Alternatively, if you would like to provide anonymous or private feedback, you are always welcome to use [the feedback form on the HOT website](https://www.hotosm.org/feedback) (for anything, not just feedback on the HOT Summit).

Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom of this post! We hope that you are as excited about this approach as we are!
