In January 2019, HOT was engaged by the United Nations’ Development Program (UNDP) to develop and update the Arua District risk profile into a spatially-focused Risk Atlas. Due to the recent influx of refugees in the northwestern part of Uganda from South Sudan, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Arua has settled over 175,000 refugees, mainly women and children according to the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). With this drastic influx of people, there is bound to be a strain on the already scarce natural resources and human services in the district. In a 2018 blog post, UNHCR and FAO estimated that the annual wood fuel consumption in a large settlement like Bidibidi - the biggest refugee settlement in Africa - is around 300,000 tonnes (UNHCR 2018). In order to better understand whether there has been a change in vulnerability and exposure to hazards such as flooding, bush fires and windstorms in the district of Arua, UNDP contracted HOT to combine its recently collected data on both refugees and host communities across the district with government verified risk and exposure boundaries in the format of shapefiles as well as vulnerability statistics. This breadth of data would be combined to develop the first granular community-centric and government verified risk atlas for the country.

The Arua Risk Atlas has the potential to assist government, development, and humanitarian actors target, plan, and implement their disaster and risk reduction initiatives from a granular, evidence-based perspective. The Atlas raises awareness of natural hazards and the exposure to and vulnerabilities of populations, critical infrastructure, protected areas, croplands, and facilities. It also guides and supports decision-makers and communities in northern Uganda to making risk-informed planning decisions with a communitarian perspective.

Over a five-month period, HOT developed the first community-based Risk Atlas in the country of its kind that included the use of open-source geographic data and drone mapping. The Risk Atlas features different maps and analyses, including a multi-hazard risk map highlighting the severity of all hazards experienced across the sub-counties of Arua district. This map was generated through a qualitative risk analysis process determined mainly by the probability and severity of the impact each hazard would have in a particular sub-county. Using the point 4 likert scale, each sub-county was then ranked and categorized by hazard and results were aggregated to develop the multi-hazard risk index. These results were styled into a map using QGIS.

There is also the Land Use / Cover Changes map showing the levels of environmental degradation in the refugee settlements and host communities in the District, enabling communities to envisage the impact of their activities in the region’s resources and planning for their future use. This map was produced by comparing two sets of Sentinel satellite imagery between 2016 and 2019. Using the unsupervised classification algorithm in QGIS, land use and land cover changes were detected and characterized. Vegetation changes were then further re-analyzed to extract areas within Arua district that had degraded.

The HOT team, in collaboration with UNDP, also engaged in hands-on workshops with the local and national authorities and community members in Arua district and central Kampala geared towards building capacity in the prevention, understanding and create awareness of the impact and likelihood of natural hazards. The five-day drone mapping and training program aimed to equip both central and local government officials with tools and software that could assist them in updating, investigating and verifying their hazard and exposure data in the field. The first three days of the program consisted of a practical workshop in Arua district, where local government representatives were introduced to drone regulations, how to operate a drone and capturing imagery. The remaining 2 days consisted of a practical workshop in Kampala, where participants learned how to process the imagery (captured in the District of Arua) and analyze the imagery using QGIS to detect change in land cover and land use.

The participatory mapping exercise held with both the local government and community members across the AOI in Arua district was another important element of this engagement. Through this exercise, HOT worked with participants to identify over 80 perceived risk and hazard areas in these local communities. The final map was produced by digitizing and combining hazard boundaries that community members had identified and traced onto paper-based sub-county maps. In this exercise, participants were asked to identify and locate the extent to which hazard affected the respective communities. These community-drawn boundaries were later digitized using JOSM - an open-source OpenStreetMap editor - which enabled merging of overlapping hazard boundaries across sub-counties. The hazard boundaries were later styled and the final map product was developed in QGIS. Once the map was finalized, the information was used to verify the government low resolution hazard and exposure datasets as provided in the Risk Profile for the district of Arua.

In June 2019, the Risk Atlas was presented to Commissioner of Disaster and Risk of the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) along with other representatives from UNDP and OPM. OPM is in the process of reviewing the Risk Atlas and the activities that encapsulates the production of this project to best decide how to integrate it with the existing Risk Profile for both Arua district and the rest of the country.
