Summary Text: This Activation follows discussions between HOT and the United Nations
  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for Mali (UNOCHA-Mali). The
  ungoing efforts to map Mali are very helpfull to humanitarian organizations.  To
  support the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/what-we-do/coordination-tools/cluster-coordination">Clusters
  coordination system</a> and the humanitarian community, we are asked to continue
  the ungoing base mapping and to contribute to the geolocation of existing datasets
  for basic services. On Jan 16 2013, the UNOCHA-Mali and his humanitarian partners
  have highlighted the complex emergency situation in Mali.

<h2>Priority areas</h2>

<a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/#all/Mali">Tasking Manager jobs for Mali</a> are already defined. This crowdsourcing approach assures coordination of mapping by numerous contributors.

These tasks have been defined to respond  to priority areas expressed by humanitarians and OCHA. Highest priority was expressed for for Bamako, Segou, Mopti, Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal .  We will be mapping many of the standard OpenStreetMap priorities, including roads, airports, waterways, buildings and landuse areas. In addition we are asked to contribute to support in <a href="http://cod.humanitarianresponse.info/about">Common and Fundamental Operational Datasets (COD/FOD)</a>.

<b>BSU (Basic Services Utilities) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest">Points of Interest (POIs)</a></b>
<ul>
<li>Health Facilities</li>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Water points</li>
</ul>

<h2>Volunteers with local knowledge</h2> 

We are looking for volunteers to geolocate facilities in infrastructure described in datasets provided by our partners.
