<p>This week six Indonesians were welcomed to the HOT project. These six university-aged Indonesians will be trained to teach OSM to government officials, teachers and students throughout the country (you can see all of the training material at <a href="www.learnosm.org">LearnOSM</a>). Under Va and Kate, three new trainers will be travelling to Kupang (East Nusa Tenggara), Makassar (South Sulawesi), and Manokwari (Papua) to teach the workshops. The other team, under the leadership of Emir and Joseph, will head to Padang (South Sumatra), Surabaya (East Java) and Bandung (West Java).<!--break--></p><p>Adityo, Dewi, Harry, Ranie, and Wulansari are studying or have graduated from University of Indonesia in Jakarta, while Elida is pursuing a Master's in Coastal and Watershed Planning at Gajah Mada University in Yogyakarta.
