<p>We wanted to take the time to thank each and every one of our individual donors who are helping to #mapthedifference in 2018. Your donations, over our goal of $30,000, will ensure that HOT is ready to respond to disasters. Additionally, it will support Microgrants for up to 5 local OSM communities to&nbsp; grow their mapping community and strengthen their responses, whenever disaster may occur or to aid efforts in rebuilding.
