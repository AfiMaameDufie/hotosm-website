<p><span style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 13.2px;">HOT has been active almost 20 hours since the devastating earthquake in Nepal. Our thoughts are with the affected communities and our fellow Mappers in the region. Every emergency is hard but for a few hours our community waited to hear if our OSM colleagues, fellow Board Member Nama </span>Budhathoki and their families were safe. They are and we are so thankful. The previous work of the local OSM community meant that the maps of Katmandu were fairly robust. Until we heard back from our local OSM colleagues and potential responders, the HOT team began searching for key parts of the map in the affected region that needed work. They updated roads and worked through the night across timezones.</p><p>Today <span style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 13.2px;">Nama reports that Kathmandu Living Labs team have assembled in a situation room. They are beginning to establish contact with response agencies. And, they are already in touch with the Nepal Redcross.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 13.2px;"><br></span><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/Katmandu%20Living%20Labs%20for%20Nepal%20Earthquake_0.png?itok=74W3e6jH" alt="" height="285" width="510">&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 13.2px;"><br>Here are the high priority areas for your help with mapping:</span></p><div style="font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 19.8px;">1.

They are responsible for the growth of OSM in the region with their partners.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 19.8px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 19.8px;"><span data-reactid=".1.0.0">If you can help them, they advised that they are having internet connection issues. Having a HOT team in the region means that they can guide the global community to map the items needed by responders. While the response priorities of search, rescue, safety and food necessities are so important, this is one thing that the technical community could help with. </span></div><div style="font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 19.8px;">&nbsp;</div><div><span data-reactid=".1.0.0">See more updates from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kathmandulivinglabs?fref=nf" target="_blank">Katmandu Living Labs on their Facebook page </a></span>and their <a href="https://twitter.com/KTMLivingLabs" target="_blank">@KTMLivingLabs twitter account. </a></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 19.8px;"><div><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
