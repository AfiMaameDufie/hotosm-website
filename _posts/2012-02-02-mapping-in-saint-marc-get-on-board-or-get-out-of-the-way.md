<p>Hey there, Hi there, Ho there,</p><p>Checking in from beautiful coastal Saint Marc. Everything has been proceeding along here at a terrific pace. Now that the team of young people to be trained is organized and ready to go the COSMHA team has been busy training and coordinating all these people. Most days start at 7:30 with a COSMHA team meeting. At 8 the youth come and there is a morning lecture. During this time the team finishes up the preparation of any materials for the days activities and maybe participates in a training them selves.</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/DSC00342.jpg" alt=""></p><p>During this implementation period the team and HOT have been working together to form some robust procedures. These procedures are being established in such a way that some technical procedures are broken down into tasks that less advanced members can complete and utilize for planning and tasking mapping activities. These are some very cool tools that we are looking forward to seeing in use for many projects in Hati and elsewhere in the future.</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/DSC00437.jpg" alt=""></p><p>All this personal success on the team has been framed by sucsesses outside as well. The partners on the project have been very happy with the progress so far. This morning the mayor of Saint Marc came to meet with all involved in the project and said some very encouraging words to the continuation of the project as well as support for further work in the area in the future. It is very rewarding to be involved in this project to see the success that is being built by the hard work of all the team, as well as already seeing doors begining to open to maintain active mapping projects in this zone.</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/DSC00249.jpg" alt=""></p><p>-Brian and Nico</p>
