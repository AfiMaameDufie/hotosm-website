<p>On Monday, the HOT Indonesian team met with Juhee and Arlene from OpenIR. This group of MIT affiliates have started a pilot study in Indonesia, specifically Jakarta and Kalimantan. They have created a portal where infrared imagery can be more easily retrieved and used. Their aims are to map ecological features and risks as revealed by the infrared satellite imagery.</p><p>Feel free to check out their work <a href="http://openir.media.mit.edu/">here</a>.</p><p><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/Selection_349_0.png?itok=7a3P6kwJ" alt="" style="width:323px;height:87px"></p><p>While they were here they experienced the Jakarta floods and so deployed a Ushahidi instance. They hope to use OpenIR for flood management purposes.</p><p>They met with our team to get some input on the portal and what direction they should go in.</p>
