<p>[Ed. Note: Guest post from <em>By <a href="https://twitter.com/geohacker" rel="noreferrer">Sajjad Anwar</a>]</em></p><p>The OpenStreetMap community all over India is rallying to aid its neighbor Nepal after the most powerful earthquake since 1934 struck the Kathmandu area.</p><p>Teams in Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pondicherry and many mappers from home have ramped up progress on the tasking manager. The coordination happens in on <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_Nepal_earthquake" rel="noreferrer">the OpenStreetMap wiki</a> and on a <a href="https://datameet.hackpad.com/Nepal-Earthquake-Mapping-YDjLauUK0Ek" rel="noreferrer">hackpad with documentation</a>.</p><p>In Bangalore, the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/nepal-earthquake" rel="noreferrer">doors of the Mapbox office are going to be open throughout the remainder of the week</a> for volunteers to drop in and improve the map. This is an open invitation to experienced mappers and new comers. If you haven't used OpenStreetMap yet, we're here to help you get started with mapping.</p><p><img class="image-large" title="Mapping Nepal photo by Gopinath Parayil" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/Mapping%20Nepal%20photo%20by%20Gopinath%20Parayil.png?itok=CIcqWCJ9" alt="mapping nepal photo" height="383" width="510"></p><p><em>Mapping Nepal <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153278367912152&amp;set=a.10150483601982152.426363.679742151&amp;type=1&amp;theater" rel="noreferrer">in Pondicherry</a> this weekend (photo: Gopinath Parayil)</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;<img class="image-large" title="Mapbox office in Indiranagar" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/Mapping%20Nepal%20%28photo%202%29.png?itok=CgK1-y27" alt="Mapbox office in Indiranagar" height="287" width="510"></em></p><p><em> The Mapbox office is <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/nepal-earthquake/" rel="noreferrer">open to volunteers all week</a>.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
