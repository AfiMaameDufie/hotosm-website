Access to accurate and updated maps is a cornerstone for countries and societies to be able to run smoothly. Without maps, transporting goods and people efficiently becomes a near-impossible task. That’s why maps and information on navigability play a big role in lifting countries out of poverty. It’s also why Mapillary and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) are teaming up in [#map2020](https://www.mapillary.com/map2020), a mapping campaign that sets to improve maps and navigation in low- and middle-income countries.

With #map2020, we invite local mapping teams in low- and middle-income countries to map their communities and challenges related to navigation. By using street-level imagery to edit OpenStreetMap (OSM), we will together make a dent in one of the biggest challenges that undermapped areas face.

Navigation ties closely to how easily people can travel from A to B in a safe, reliable, and efficient way. There are many ways to map this in OSM.

**Here are some that come to mind**:

* Enhancing basemap data such as road classification, speed-limits, surface type, and street names to improve routing results

* Street-lighting to provide a safely lit route for people travelling at night

* The adequacy and location of sidewalks, footpaths, and crosswalks so that pedestrians can move at a safe distance away from traffic

* The routes that are typically taken by unofficial transportation such as dalla-dallas, matatus, and jeepneys

* Wheelchair accessibility as it relates to sidewalks and building entrances

The data contained within the OSM basemap is one of the most significant factors affecting the accuracy of navigation data. Without speed limits and road names, for instance, map users won’t be able to get reliable routing estimates from one location to another. That’s why we’re focusing this year’s #map2020 on navigation issues.

The campaign will run until the end of April, when final project submissions will be reviewed by a committee and the winners announced. Representatives from the most successful projects will be awarded a fully-funded trip to HOT Summit taking place on July 1 and 2 in Cape Town, South Africa, to present their project findings to the international humanitarian mapping community.

**How to take part**

There are many interesting elements to navigation and we’re looking forward to seeing which ones participating projects choose to focus on. We’ve developed the following criteria to ensure participating projects align with the goals of #map2020.

* **You’re mapping in a low- or middle-income country**\
  All projects need to take place in a low- or middle-income country, as defined by the World Bank. If you’re unsure if the country you want to map qualifies, [check here](https://data.worldbank.org/income-level/low-and-middle-income).

* **Your mapping project is looking to improve navigation**\
  All mapping projects in #map2020 need to address navigation with the goal of improving it.

* **Your mapping team will collect and use street-level imagery to map navigation-related features in OSM**\
  You will capture street-level images with smartphones or action cameras and upload them to Mapillary. The images will then be used to edit and improve OpenStreetMap by adding features to the map that help improve navigation results.

* **Someone from your mapping team would be available to present your mapping project at HOT Summit in Cape Town in July 2020**\
  Mapillary and HOT will sponsor representatives from the most successful projects to travel to the HOT Summit in Cape Town in July, where they will present their findings. A representative from the project must be available and willing to present their work at the HOT Summit.

This is the second time Mapillary and HOT team up for a mapping campaign with a humanitarian focus. We saw hundreds of thousands of images come in from all over the world during last year’s #map2020 as mapping groups tackled different humanitarian challenges in their community by improving the map. This year, we’re excited to level up and hone in on navigation specifically. Better navigation is needed in many places, but there are no places where the impact will be greater than in undermapped regions.
