**Field Strategy **

The HOT Philippines mapping team rolled out a new field strategy in order to maximize manpower and keep up with the timeline of activities for PhilAWARE. Below, an excerpt from the January 2021 report submitted to PDC:

*The team experimented with different strategies on how to approach field mapping. The team implemented a plan where one member from each team will be processing data remotely while the others continue field mapping. The team members will alternate between field mapping and data processing. The team plans to utilize this system on a case-by-case basis for each municipality. This will speed up the data processing for each field area. The table below shows a sample of how the system would work:*

# Data Validator Selection for PhilAWARE

In order to speed up the validation process for the PhilAWARE project, the HOT Philippines mapping team is accepting local volunteer applicants to become data validators. Local applicants may apply through this form online. The data validation leads of HOT are in charge of screening local applicants.

# OSM Philippines Meeting

On January 17, 2021, OSM Philippines held our annual planning, going through a 2020 recap of activities and milestones (led by Maning Sambale), reviewing the OSMPH Code of Conduct (drafted by GeoLadies PH and Ministry of Mapping), drafting the 2021 OSM calendar (led by Eugene Villar), and organizing sign-ups for the CoC, the Wiki pages, and general communications and engagement working groups.
