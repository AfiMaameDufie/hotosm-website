<p>Having had a brief moment to get out footing in Saint Marc, we were supplied with our next missions to accomplish. The supplies for the team to conduct their work and training in Saint Marc arrived and with it came the need to set up, inventory, and configure all of the equipment for the next weeks work.&nbsp;<!--break--></p><p><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/DSC00313_0_0.jpg?itok=tj1D2dq_" alt="" height="351" width="467"></p><p>With many new GPS, laptops, and accessories to process the team spent the weekend unpackaging, labeling, recording, configuring, and storing equipment. Every team member was needed for the install party, in which 12 brand new laptops were cleaned of unnecessary software and given the necessary security settings and softwares needed for the next months of work. It was a truly trying time for our internet connection but everyone prevailed, some controlling two laptops at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/DSC00316_1_0.jpg?itok=Xo8FaYpF" alt="" height="360" width="480"></p><p>After that came the need to have our tagging presets, survey forms, and documentation prepared before the start of coming week. division of labor, both inside of country and out, came together to accomplish this, and after many long night we have arrived at an incredibly solid product that will be able to be applicable to project inside and outside of Haiti for long to come.&nbsp;</p><p><img class="image-large" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/DSC00280_0_0.jpg?itok=V1odPECB" alt="" height="471" width="354"></p><p>Very helpful to our productivity over this Sunday was our hosts here at le Troquet playing live guitar on the patio in front of our base home. This was a much needed reminder that despite it was a day of work, it was still a Sunday. Without it I doubt we would have been able to weather our multi-day sprint so well!</p><p>-Brian and Nico</p>
