<p>OpenAerialMap is focused on creating a simple and easy experience for finding and publishing aerial imagery. This past week, we released three new features that are live on OpenAerialMap.org. As HOT kicks off the <a href="https://hotosm.org/updates/2016-07-20_hot_launches_new_pacdid_drone_imagery_project">Pacific Drone Imagery Dashboard (PacDID) project</a>, we’ve begun to add new features to improve access to latest imagery, documentation, and unify features of the system. The OAM team presented these new features at <a href="http://stateofthemap.us/workshops/">State of the Map US</a> on July 25th 2016 in a joint workshop with <a href="http://opendronemap.github.io/odm/">OpenDroneMap</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>New landing page</strong></h2><p>An important focus we set out to achieve was to build a more unified experience that provides the information and workflow for finding and publishing imagery. We’ve redesigned the primary view for accessing OpenAerialMap to focus on providing more information, improving navigation, and highlighting the community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last few weeks, we’ve discussed and implemented these priorities into a new layout. Building off of OAM’s <a href="https://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2016/07/14/reusable-design-components/">new design system</a>, the new layout begins to highlight the tools and community. We’ve provided more information about OAM and the documentation around the tools. There’s also now ample space to highlight and showcase additional tools built off the platform as well, such as PacDID. The navigation at the top now provides a method for getting to the Browser and documentation, as well as, provides a structure for building out additional pages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/oam-landing-compressor.png" alt="" style="width:2670px;height:2808px"></p><h2><strong>Latest Imagery View</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>One component of the new landing view is a new Latest Imagery section. This new section provides a way to visually see the most recently collected imagery. As imagery is indexed within the system, the most recently collected images will be highlighted within this section. Anyone can can easily navigate to the imagery to download and begin using the new imagery. In addition, we’ve added a new Latest Imagery button within the Browser to take you the most recent image while you’re within the map Browser.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/oam-latest-compressor.png" alt="" style="width:2720px;height:1386px"></p><h2><strong>Report issues</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The last new feature we’ve added is a Report Issue button within the Browser. Now if you encounter an error, see a mistake, or have a question about imagery, you can easily report an issue. The report is a simple form that submits information about your current view along with your message. These reports will help us identify and fix issues to provide a better experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check out all these new features on <a href="https://openaerialmap.org/">openaerialmap.org</a>.
