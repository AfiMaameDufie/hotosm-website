<p>A few weeks ago HOT was a guest of the <strong><a href="http://ihtc.ieee.ca/">2014 IEEE Canada International Humanitarian Technology Conference</a> (IHTC). </strong>&nbsp; In the session, Samual Paul Alce, Pierre Beland and I each presented about to share all about the community, activations and how to use OpenStreetmap. It was an honour to participate and share the HOT story with such an important organization. It is our goal to build relationships with groups like IEEE to improve processes and technical implementation.&nbsp; We would like to thank Alfredo Herrara, Glenn McKnight and the whole IEEE IHTC team for inviting us. Here is the abstract and our slides with speaker's notes:</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1401287258247_24404"><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1401287258247_24403"><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1401287258247_24402"><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1401287258247_24401">Since the Haiti&nbsp; earthquake in 2010, new partners support the UN Agencies and International organizations through the Web 2.0 or Collaborative Web.&nbsp; OpenStreetMap is one of these community of volunteers.

The workshop will include an overview of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Teamâ€™s (HOT) activities, some of the tools and best practices. We will include stories of activations around the world from Indonesia to Haiti to Philippines and the DRC. Our session also includes hands on training from HOT community leaders. Join us and learn about new methods in digital and in-person responders using OpenStreetMap.</p><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/heatherleson/introduction-to-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team">Introduction to Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team </a>(Heather)</p><p><a href="http://fr.slideshare.net/pierzen/open-streetmap-responsetohumanitariancrisishaiyanebolaieeemontreal20130601">OpenStreetMap response to Humanitarian Crisis Haiyan</a> (Pierre)</p><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AlceSamuelPaul/hot-osm-ieee-international-humanitarian-technology-conference">OpenStreetMap Technical Training</a> (Samuel)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AlceSamuelPaul/hot-osm-ieee-international-humanitarian-technology-conference" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p>
