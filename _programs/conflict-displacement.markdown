  Header: Mapping areas vulnerable to disaster
  Text: Through the Missing Maps project, the HOT global community creates maps of
    high vulnerability areas where data is scarce, putting an area home to millions
    of people onto the world map in OpenStreetMap.

  Narrative-title: About
  Narrative-intro-text: 'Compounding social, political, and environmental risks are
    leading to a surge of people in need of humanitarian aid with increasingly limited
    resources. A record number of people are living in displacement and in areas of
    difficult access. Gathering information in these areas can be challenging, which
    is where HOT works with local and global mapping communities to fill these gaps
    through coordination and improved data crowdsourcing.   '
  Narrative-text: Understanding the geographic context of conflict affected areas,
    including where people are, how to access them, and the state of local infrastructure
    is critical to plan adequate aid to meet basic human needs. Through this program,
    HOT collaborates with expert partners to link crowdsourced and participatory mapping
    methodologies to humanitarian data users. Our context specific projects address
    spatial data gaps and promote the responsible use of open data and methodologies
    in conflict-affected areas, areas of displacement, and host communities.<br><br>
    HOT holds itself and its partners to highly responsible data standards guided
    by [HOT’s data principles](https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data/data-principles/).
    All work done through this program complies with [HOT’s data protection framework](https://github.com/hotosm/data_protection_project/).

Approach-text: For 13 years, HOT has worked in collaboration with local communities
  to put the places they live on the world map. Our global community of 600K+ volunteers
  map buildings, roads, and key infrastructure on OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free open
  source map of the world. Our four Regional Hubs work in 94 countries, connecting
  with local organizations, government agencies, international networks, and others
  to ground truth map data and get locally created maps into the hands of decision-makers.
  Community knowledge, needs, and solutions are at the center, with HOT facilitating
  the end-to-end process of identifying missing data, mapping, analyzing data, and
  using that data effectively.

Project-text:
  Project Summary Text: At Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we are addressing
    climate data gaps by working with local communities and partners to take anticipatory
    action. We ensure their realities are represented on the map and that communities
    are involved in climate-related decisions that will affect them.

    to put the places they live on the world map. Our global community of 600K+ volunteers

  Narrative-title: Conflict & Displacement
  Narrative-introduction: Anticipatory action serves as a crucial link between long-term
    disaster risk reduction and immediate humanitarian response, particularly amidst
    the compounded threats of climate change and disasters. <a href="https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb7145en">According
    to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</a>, every dollar invested in anticipatory
    action could give families seven dollars in benefits and avoid losses. However,
    anticipatory action efforts in vulnerable areas are hindered by a lack of data.
  Narrative: HOT’s Mapping for Climate-Ready Cities program will make open map data
    available in high-risk cities before a disaster strikes so that it can be used
    to plan for and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather and climate events. The
    proactive approach of this program will enable enhanced coordination and community
    involvement, facilitating early determination of response strategies and providers
    with ample time for training and capacity building. By leveraging map data to
    take preemptive measures, this program will mitigate potential crises, thereby
    saving resources and time and averting displacement, disease, and livelihood losses.
  Objectives-title-1: 'Map 8-10 major cities across 4 regions by 2025 with a focus
    on the most vulnerable populations in those locations. '
  Objective1: 'Complete an open map of critical infrastructure and environmental systems,
    including public centers, hospitals, homes, roads, waterways, coastlines, etc.
    Next, identify and map local climate risks in each city starting from tested risk
    and hazard modeling. These risks include, for example, the extent and severity
    of past flooding or neighborhood effects from changes to sea levels. Criteria
    for the cities selected include: climate vulnerability, local community capacity
    and interest, extent of existing map data, and access to recent aerial imagery.'
  Objectives-title-2: Enable local representatives to collect, analyze & use map data
    to advocate for climate-resilient policy and planning decisions.
  Objective2: "<ul><li>neighborhoods of each city. We will train local communities,
    government agencies, and organizations in collecting map data and open data use
    skills to catalyze citizen science. We will provide networking opportunities and
    grants to ensure peer-to-peer exchange.</li></ul>"
  Objectives-title-3: Embed open climate data into existing workflows to create data-informed
    policies & climate-action plans.
  Objective3: "<ul><li> Support local government, implementing partners and other
    stakeholders to build information systems that allow them take this community-centered
    approach forward independently: identifying challenges, collecting and analyzing
    data with local communities, and then using map information to collaboratively
    develop solutions. More, better and up-to-date data means that locals, advocates
    and decision-makers can make more rapid and better decisions.</li></ul>"
