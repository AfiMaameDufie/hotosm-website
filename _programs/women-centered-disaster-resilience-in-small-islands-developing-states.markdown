  Header: Mapping areas vulnerable to disaster
  Text: Through the Missing Maps project, the HOT global community creates maps of
    high vulnerability areas where data is scarce, putting an area home to millions
    of people onto the world map in OpenStreetMap.

  Program Summary Text: "<a>**We work with women and girls in Small Island Developing
    States to help them gain critical mapping skills. This program aims to build local
    disaster resilience with a gender perspective by fostering collaboration among
    women leaders.**</a>"

Narrative-section:
  Narrative-title: About
  Narrative-intro-text: According to the UN, most people displaced and who are vulnerable
    to displacement due to climate change are women in Small Island Developing States
    (SIDS). **Their unequal decision-making power undermines emergency recovery efforts
    and development at every level**, which adds to the hardships usually faced in
    those islands as a result of their shared similarities, including their isolation
    from the mainland, their reliance on industries like tourism, and their high vulnerability
    to natural disasters and climate change with inadequate infrastructures to protect
    their populations. Furthering these challenges is that there are not enough mapping
    specialists, OpenStreetMap communities are small or nonexistent, and few are women.
  Narrative-text: 'This program focuses on **improving the well-being and increasing
    the agency and resilience of women and girls who live in SIDS** by building their
    capacity to create, access, and use open map data. <br><br> Three islands were
    selected as pilot projects: **Trinidad and Tobago, Timor Leste, and the Archipel
    of Saloum Islands in Senegal**. Those places were selected mainly due to the availability
    of partners in the island. From February 2023, we were able to start developing
    partnership agreements with identified partners and define the scope of the work.
    Partners were asked to develop a proposal that would be validated by HOTOSM.'

  Title: Proposed Program Goals & Objectives
  Icon1: fa-regular fa-map
  Objective1: " Grow mapping communities"
  Objective1-highlight: 
  Objectives-title-1: 1.- <strong>Increase the presence of OpenStreetMap (OSM) and
    open-source communities</strong> in SIDS that are underrepresented and underserved
    in these fields. <br><br> 2.- <strong>Women communities are trained in core map
    competencies</strong> e.g. project management, Geographic Information Systems
    mapping, mobile data collection, etc. <br><br> 3.- Open mapping champions and
    influencers (groups and individuals) are identified and strengthened
  Icon2: fa-solid fa-venus
  Objective2: Women-centered capacity building
  Objective2-highlight: 
  Objectives-title-2: '1.- <strong>Build out women-centered projects</strong> in small
    island developing states that are faced with disasters. <br><br> 2.- Women communities
    in SIDS have the knowledge, tools, funding, and geo-data to implement and advocate
    for socio-economic change. <br><br> 3.-Women in underrepresented groups in SIDS
    are connected to tools and are motivated to create geographical data and solutions. '
  Icon3: fa-solid fa-users-line
  Objective3: " Peer-to-peer support"
  Objective3-highlight: 
  Objectives-title-3: '1.- <strong>Women in SIDS share knowledge and lessons learned</strong>
    from within and across different regions. <br><br> 2.- A diverse makeup of women
    community champions and partners are increasingly networked to each other sharing
    learning and knowledge. <br><br> 3.- Women communities in SIDS have an <strong>open
    dialogue and collaborate with local/global actors from all sectors</strong>. '
Approach-text: For 13 years, HOT has worked in collaboration with local communities
  to put the places they live on the world map. Our global community of 600K+ volunteers
  map buildings, roads, and key infrastructure on OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free open
  source map of the world. Our four Regional Hubs work in 94 countries, connecting
  with local organizations, government agencies, international networks, and others
  to ground truth map data and get locally created maps into the hands of decision-makers.
  Community knowledge, needs, and solutions are at the center, with HOT facilitating
  the end-to-end process of identifying missing data, mapping, analyzing data, and
  using that data effectively.

Project-text:
  Project Summary Text: At Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), we are addressing
    climate data gaps by working with local communities and partners to take anticipatory
    action. We ensure their realities are represented on the map and that communities
    are involved in climate-related decisions that will affect them.
  Introduction: 
  Methodology-title: HOT’s Approach
  Methodology: For 13 years, HOT has worked in collaboration with local communities
    to put the places they live on the world map. Our global community of 600K+ volunteers
    map buildings, roads, and key infrastructure on OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free open
    source map of the world. Our four Regional Hubs work in 94 countries, connecting
    with local organizations, government agencies, international networks, and others
    to ground truth map data and get locally created maps into the hands of decision-makers.
    Community knowledge, needs, and solutions are at the center, with HOT facilitating
    the end-to-end process of identifying missing data, mapping, analyzing data, and
    using that data effectively.
  Narrative-title: Program Focus and Implementation
  Narrative-introduction: Anticipatory action serves as a crucial link between long-term
    disaster risk reduction and immediate humanitarian response, particularly amidst
    the compounded threats of climate change and disasters. <a href="https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb7145en">According
    to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</a>, every dollar invested in anticipatory
    action could give families seven dollars in benefits and avoid losses. However,
    anticipatory action efforts in vulnerable areas are hindered by a lack of data.
  Narrative: HOT’s Mapping for Climate-Ready Cities program will make open map data
    available in high-risk cities before a disaster strikes so that it can be used
    to plan for and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather and climate events. The
    proactive approach of this program will enable enhanced coordination and community
    involvement, facilitating early determination of response strategies and providers
    with ample time for training and capacity building. By leveraging map data to
    take preemptive measures, this program will mitigate potential crises, thereby
    saving resources and time and averting displacement, disease, and livelihood losses.
  Objectives-title-1: 'Map 8-10 major cities across 4 regions by 2025 with a focus
    on the most vulnerable populations in those locations. '
  Objective1: 'Complete an open map of critical infrastructure and environmental systems,
    including public centers, hospitals, homes, roads, waterways, coastlines, etc.
    Next, identify and map local climate risks in each city starting from tested risk
    and hazard modeling. These risks include, for example, the extent and severity
    of past flooding or neighborhood effects from changes to sea levels. Criteria
    for the cities selected include: climate vulnerability, local community capacity
    and interest, extent of existing map data, and access to recent aerial imagery.'
  Objectives-title-2: Enable local representatives to collect, analyze & use map data
    to advocate for climate-resilient policy and planning decisions.
  Objective2: "<ul><li>neighborhoods of each city. We will train local communities,
    government agencies, and organizations in collecting map data and open data use
    skills to catalyze citizen science. We will provide networking opportunities and
    grants to ensure peer-to-peer exchange.</li></ul>"
  Objectives-title-3: Embed open climate data into existing workflows to create data-informed
    policies & climate-action plans.
  Objective3: "<ul><li> Support local government, implementing partners and other
    stakeholders to build information systems that allow them take this community-centered
    approach forward independently: identifying challenges, collecting and analyzing
    data with local communities, and then using map information to collaboratively
    develop solutions. More, better and up-to-date data means that locals, advocates
    and decision-makers can make more rapid and better decisions.</li></ul>"
