Happy September everyone!! Following the hot_tech team in Florence, August 2022 blog , I wanted to share some updates and reflections after the conferences! It has been an AMAZING experience - for some of us this was the first time attending, for others not, but I’d say the excitement was the same! We were all eager to reconnect with like minded OSM enthusiasts!
