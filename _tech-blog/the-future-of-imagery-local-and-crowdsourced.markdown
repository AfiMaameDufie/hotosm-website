After observing the imagery challenges experienced in Turkey and Syria (top challenge being lack of access to up-to-date, non-cloudy imagery) in the days after the earthquake (and now this news about Maxar discontinuing their services), 

High dependence on (often low quality or out-of-date) imagery from limited, proprietary sources and the lack of open source imagery is not a new concern. Ideas and discussions on how to mitigate these risks and explore alternatives have been going on for some time already. This is why we already have an imagery repository, [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org/), ready for people to openly upload, store and download open-licensed imagery.

only makes the timing even more relevant for us to amp up our work to prepare for the future of open imagery. Moreover, with AI-assisted mapping services becoming increasingly relevant and feasible, securing local, raw imagery of quality (ground and aerial) will be even more essential for us to effectively train the AI models and make them fit for detecting map features in a locally relevant fashion (see fAIr for more info on today's efforts).
As one step towards mitigating the risk of our dependence on limited sources of imagery and preparing for the future, we established a co-working group on this very topic a few months back. When we talk about imagery here, we are talking about for example imagery from 360 cameras providing ground overview or aerial imagery from drones providing below-the-clouds (=clear) overview of e.g. terrain, building height etc. The aim of this coworking is i) to acknowledge the immense passion and expertise within the open source community, ii) create alliances with the free and open source community (so far incl. e.g. Red Cross, Nepal Flying Labs, OpenDroneMap, Bangladesh Open Innovation Lab to mention a few) and iii) to draw on the collective intelligence of the group's expertise, experience and knowledge to explore alternative sources of imagery. Crowdsourcing of local imagery is one core approach we are exploring.
Diversity in expertise, knowledge and experience has proven to be key to creatively solving problems in the past, and we therefore welcome anyone who is eager to engage, contribute, learn and/or discuss the future of humanitarian imagery!
