Hello Tasking Manager enthusiasts! It has been a while since you heard from us. We wanted to share some updates since we kicked off our collective efforts with the Kathmandu Living labs team  on the Tasking Manager earlier this year and [shared a blog on how to contribute](https://www.hotosm.org/tech-blog/welcome-to-the-tasking-manager-collective-how-to-join-and-contribute/). 

## What we have been up to:
A lot has been happening thanks to the hard working team at Kathmandu Living Labs, HOT_tech team  and all of YOU contributing and joining the collective. Here are a few of the highlights that we wanted to update you on:

As an open tech collective, the focus has been on maintanance for the Tasking Manager, including a **number of bug fixes and some feature enhancements**. Some highlights include allowing users to select multiple tasks at once for validation, redirecting to previous project after unlocking tasks,  and bringing Rapid ID in the Tasking Manager. All updates on progress of work are available on a monthly basis in the [Github project board-Month Wise Updates column](https://github.com/orgs/hotosm/projects/4). Discussion on specific issues also happens publicly on [Github](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/issues).


We launched the **monthly Tasking Manager Collective Meet Ups **in April 2022 and we have really enjoyed having this space to interact directly with users, understand their needs better and prioritize based on user needs. Our focus from the start has always been on building with, for, and by the community and we are very excited that these meets up are taking place! All updates and links to presentations can be seen in the [agenda rolling doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SW7Klq49pD35k-gQIQT3UhhgVxF4yr6OfNIg1hXFeQA/edit#).
