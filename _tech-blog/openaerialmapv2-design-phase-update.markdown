We wanted to provide you with an update of the next phase of the OpenAerialMap Project. Hopefully you have already read the [Kick Off blog](https://www.hotosm.org/tech-blog/openaerialmap-v2-design-kicks-off/). You can see an overview of the different project phases and where we currently are!

I am sure you will be interested to know what has happened since mid-April. Well, the Kontur team has been pretty busy!

Following completion of the Discovery phase (you can read the full report summarizing research and discovery phase [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCXx6D8F6Xz4vLhamT794IE_Zegp3eaSG9kV_QT0KUk/edit), the Kontur team went into the Designing phase, which included a number of workshop activities! We want to start by thanking everyone who participated in the workshop with ideas and suggestions!  17 participants from 13 community groups took part in 3 workshops at the end of April.  You can see the location of where people joined in the virtual workshops below - we were very pleased with the diversity of participants in the workshops!
