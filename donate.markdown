Millions of people around the world are still not represented on maps. Voices of local communities are unheard, as they are left out in access to basic services like health or education, and are not included in relief operations when disasters strike. Mapping has enabled all individuals and communities to utilize technology for local development and to create a community of mappers by teaching and sharing information.

For the past two years, you’ve enabled us to provide Microgrants in 20 countries. We’ve seen the impact of this program not just on communities, but the Micrograntees themselves; the individuals, the local leaders who have been empowered to flourish into local leaders, working with endless dedication to make sure that their communities, their neighborhoods and their people have access to relevant tools, data and training to be able to thrive. This year we’re #mappingthedifference with local leaders.
