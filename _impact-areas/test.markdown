Solving global challenges requires an understanding of our physical environment that is grounded in the day-to-day realities of people experiencing those challenges. Open mapping helps us co-develop that understanding together, which enables humanitarian, development, and community organizations to take more informed and locally-appropriate action. Each Impact Area describes one of the major global challenges the open mapping movement is taking on. Impact Areas ensure all efforts across HOT - partnerships, grantmaking, and community support - are focused on contributing to one of five major issue areas.
