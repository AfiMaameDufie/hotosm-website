summary: Equal access & participation in open mapping. Improved understanding and
  accounting of gendered experiences & issues in all impact areas.
block-1:
  intro: The daily experiences of people in a society can be drastically different
    based on their gender identity and gender expression. It’s also clear that the
    gender of those contributing to OSM affects the information that specifically
    affects or are more relevant to one gender. Increasing inclusion in mapping and
    focusing on gender-sensitive tagging can support more equitable outcomes.
  intro2: HOT implements a range of impactful programs that leverage open map data to address humanitarian challenges globally. Working in over 94 countries, we collaborate with local communities, governments, and organizations to create and maintain detailed, **accessible maps that aid local communities, NGOs, and governments in making informed decisions and improving lives.**
