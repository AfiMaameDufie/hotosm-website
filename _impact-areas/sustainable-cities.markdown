In line with the New Urban Agenda and the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, HOT uses open mapping as a tool to improve equity, resilience, and quality of life for urban residents. Mapping work focuses on urban dwellings and infrastructure such as waste management systems, transportation links, and green spaces, to improve the social, economic and environmental quality of settlements. Slum dwellers and those living in unplanned settlements are engaged directly through a participatory process described in the [Open Cities Guide.](https://opendri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Planning-an-Open-Cities-Mapping-Project_0.pdf)
