  Title: Eastern & Southern Africa
  Text: "**The Open Mapping Hub - Eastern and Southern Africa **works with organizations
    and communities across 23 countries in creating and updating free, editable and
    shareable open map data in OpenStreetMap. We believe that open map data is universal
    and contributes to identifying problems, monitoring change, managing and responding
    to events, forecasting, setting priorities and understanding humanitarian and
    development trends. \nWe envision a future where all people in Eastern and Southern
    Africa have the opportunity to contribute to and use open mapping processes and
    open data in their everyday lives."

  Title: Asia Pacific
  Text: "<strong>The Open Mapping Hub - Asia-Pacific</strong> is working to create
    a sustainable OpenStreetMap (OSM) ecosystem in Asia-Pacific. We work with open
    mapping organizations and communities in the region across 25 countries to expand
    and deepen the open mapping work in the region to generate meaningful data and
    promote its effective use. <br /><br />We aspire to see government, humanitarian
    and development agencies commonly using OSM data in their planning and decision-making.
    We are also committed to providing funding, training and support, and to promoting
    the active participation of underrepresented groups and individuals in the OSM
    movement."
