  Text: |-
    *“Our primary goal was to have HOT as part of the event since they share the same OSM and OSGeo community ideals. I really liked the 2022 SotM and FOSS4G organization and believe it should be continued in the future, with a closer relationship of the three communities, something like federated events or similar. HOT is providing a great help in organization and supporting people from low-middle income countries that should be one of the main targets of the audience.”*

  Title: Comments by Local Organizing Committees (LOCs)
  Text: "*“Thank you for this opportunity! Without HOT it would have been impossible
    for us to achieve our dream to be together again and dream of the future of our
    impact on Brazilian favelas. At this event we worked together as one TETO BRASIL,
    we shared experiences and most of all, we spent quality time with the ones that
    make everything happen. As we say: ‘COMECOU NAO PARA! We won't stop until poverty
    ends in Brazilian favelas!’ And of course we would love to count with HOT next
    year!!”* \n\n- LOC, Teto Brasil annual gathering + Cidade em Foco\n\n"

  Title: Outcomes
  Text: |
    * Following the conference, OSGeo Oceania (one of the organizing partners) set up an OpenStreetMap special interest group and registered as an organization on the HOT Tasking Manager in order to support communities in the region to undertake remote mapping campaigns.

    * New connections for communities and individuals in Peru were formed, leading to collective and collaborative local mapping projects and activities

    * A community in Ecuador integrated new knowledge and motivation on drone use into their focus and activities.

    * A collaborative relationship was established between Teto Brasil and the URBELATAM / Preventório favela mapping community.

    * The unSummit programme inspired and made possible new community conferences in Brazil and Nigeria reaching more than 300 people.

    * Two Brazilian community groups with a shared interest in river mapping were introduced to each other.
