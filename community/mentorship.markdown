The HOT Community Working Group initiated a Mentorship Program to provide peer to peer learning and knowledge exchange in the humanitarian and open mapping space. 

We built upon the knowledge and efforts of other mapping communities in conducting their mentorship program, most specifically [Women+ in Geospatial (W+G) Mentorship Programme.](https://womeningeospatial.org/mentorship-programme/)

The pilot program was initiated in 2022 and continued in 2023.
