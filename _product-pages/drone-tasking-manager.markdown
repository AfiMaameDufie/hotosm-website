Block 0:
  Header: 
  Text: Open-source tool designed to support collaborative remote mapping activity

Block 1:
  Section: What is it?
  Header: A user-friendly, inclusive application suite enabling anyone with access
    to a drone, even an inexpensive consumer or DIY drone, to contribute easily and
    effectively to a global free and open aerial imagery repository.
  Text: 'Local people with low-cost, consumer-type drones can choose areas to fly
    and receive flight plans that automate precision aerial imagery collection missions,
    seamlessly combining the efforts of multiple operators into high­quality coverage
    of 2D and 3D imagery. '

Block 2:
  Header: Field Data Collection
  Text: fAIr is an open AI-assisted mapping service developed by the Humanitarian
    OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) that aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of mapping
    efforts for humanitarian purposes.
  Rectangle-1:
    Icon: fa-solid fa-paper-plane
    Header: Use Low-Cost Drones
    Highlight: DTM empowers local communities to produce their own aerial imagery
      by enabling local <strong>use of safe. affordable, lightly-regulated drones</strong>
      to create high-quality, high­resolution 2D and 3D images and base layers.
  Rectangle-2:
    Icon: fa-solid fa-group-arrows-rotate
    Header: Coordinate Efforts
    Highlight: Current commercial drone platforms don't enable multiple operators
      to collaborate to cover a large area. <strong>DTM empowers communities to work
      together to image their own environment seamlessly and at scale.</strong>
  Rectangle-3:
    Icon: fa-solid fa-circle-nodes
    Header: AI & Field Mapping
    Highlight: We're all excited about the potential for Al and field mapping tools
      to power greater community mapping efforts. But <strong>Al and field mappers
      need imagery!</strong> DTM empowers communities to create those imagery inputs
      themselves.
Block 3:
  Header: Why DTM?
  Highlight: Aerial imagery is critical for mapping, but we have been dependent on
    satellites or large, expensive, dangerous drones (usually operated by contractors
    from abroad).
  Text: 'DATM empowers local communities to create high­quality aerial imagery by
    combining the efforts of multiple people with small, safe, accessible drones.
    <br><br> <strong>Social Impact:</strong><br> &nbsp;- <u>Collaboration</u>, Communities
    working together to create local aerial imagery at scale. <br> &nbsp;- <u>Independence</u>,
    People can generate their own data for use with Al and field mapping tools. <br>
    &nbsp;- <u>Empowerment</u>, Community led aerial imagery creation. <br><br> '

Block 4:
  Header: Open Aerial Map (OAM)
  Text: OpenAerialMap is an open service to provide access to a commons of openly
    licensed imagery and map layer services. Download or contribute imagery to the
    growing commons of openly licensed imagery.

Block 5:
  Header: Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM)
  Text: The FMTM is a standalone mobile and web application that works using OpenDataKit
    (ODK), a powerful data collection platform that leverages commonly-available mobile
    Android devices to enable people to input information including geospatial data
    in the field.
