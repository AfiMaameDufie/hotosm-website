Intro text: Historically, women and gender-diverse people have been underrepresented
  in the mapping community. Increasing their inclusion in mapping activities and focusing
  on gender-sensitive tagging can lead to a map that more accurately represents the
  world around us, which creates more equitable outcomes. That is why we strive to
  enable gender-focused projects that directly speak to gendered issues in the disaster
  and humanitarian sector, as well as integrate gender-sensitive data across the rest
  of our Impact Areas to improve the quality of life for communities vulnerable to
  disasters or experiencing poverty.
Block-1:
  Title: About the Gender Equality Fund (GEF)
  Text: 'The Fund''s purpose is to map together with women and gender non-conforming
    people living in communities vulnerable to a wide variety of impacts. Our goal
    is for them to have access to teams, tools, data, and resources dedicated to humanitarian
    action and community development through open mapping. This will foster disaster
    management, risk reduction, and resilient and sustainable practices that center
    their concerns. '

  Title: HOT's role
  Text: 'As an organization that partners with local communities in need of sustainable
    funding for their mapping projects with a gender focus, as well as with donors
    looking to promote gender equality, here at HOT we are uniquely positioned to
    **act as a catalyst and connect both sides to make sure the that the goals of
    all parts are achieved**. '

This fund is vested in HOTâ€™s approach toward localization and community grant-making, and we expect to raise $5 million US Dollars from transformational gifts from foundations, institutions, and individual donors which will be strategically aligned with local, female and gender-diverse led mapping projects throughout our four regional hubs: Latin America and the Caribbean; East and South Africa, West and North Africa; and Asia Pacific.
