Canoa de Tolda Project aimed to train local people from the lower stretch of São Francisco River basin to collect data that will enable, for the first time in the region, high-precision, collaborative digital terrain modeling. The data will enable the mapping of populations in areas at risk of flooding. 

The region has been suffering from the serious impacts of climate change, with drastic periods of drought and flood. The increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts can cause perennial rivers to become intermittent. Intermittent rivers can disappear. Similarly, heavy rains and the lack of urban planning put communities at risk who directly depend on the river for basic socio-economic activities.
