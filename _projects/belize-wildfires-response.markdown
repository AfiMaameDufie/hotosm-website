# CONTEXT

Belize is grappling with unprecedented wildfires that have destroyed over 10,000 hectares of agricultural land, affected more than 200 families, and caused over eight million US dollars in damages¹. The fires, fueled by extreme drought and rising temperatures, have devastated wildlife habitats and threatened communities, particularly in the Cayo and Toledo Districts. The National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) reported severe impacts in villages like San Pedro Columbia and Crique Jute. In response, the Open Mapping Hub in Latin America and the Caribbean has launched efforts to support recovery, working with local partners to assess data needs and enhance future preparedness.
