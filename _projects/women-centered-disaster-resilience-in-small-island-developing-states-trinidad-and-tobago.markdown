The vulnerabilities of men and women differ during the disaster-management cycle as women and girls are less likely than men to have life-saving skills during a natural disaster. Further, little attention is paid to women’s needs in emergency-relief attempts in terms of privacy, personal hygiene, and sanitation. 
While women and girls have been recognized as a “vulnerable” group, their capacities to respond to events and to be drivers of risk reduction are less recognized. Building women’s and girls’ resources for resilience will help reduce future disaster impact. 

With this in mind, the GIS Society of Trinidad and Tobago (GISSTT) launched the Women-Centered Disaster Resilience in SIDS (WCDR in SIDS) Program to educate a female-led organization in the use of GIS technology and concepts to increase their capacity to respond to natural disasters and other crises. Trinidad and Tobago, a small island developing state (SIDS) in the Caribbean region, experiences major flooding events throughout the country during its rainy season, which has had a significant economic and social impact throughout the years.

The Penal/Debe region is one of many areas affected by flooding during the rainy season. Flooding in this area is due to high amounts and high rainfall intensity, soil type, and runoff capacity, as well as man-made causes such as deforestation, slash and burn, poor land practices, urbanization, and improper waste disposal. The region is susceptible to riverine and flash flooding.

With this in mind, the GIS Society of Trinidad and Tobago (GISSTT) launched the Women-Centered Disaster Resilience in SIDS (WCDR in SIDS) Program to educate a female-led organization in the use of GIS technology and concepts to increase their capacity to respond to natural disasters and other crises. 

Advocating for the understanding and use of GIS amongst a younger demographic is one of the ideals of the GISSTT. The Parvati Girls Hindu College (PGHC), an all-female high school located in S.S. Erin Road, Debe, was invited to be a part of the WCDR in SIDS. The school is located in an area susceptible to flooding, and many of the students residing in the area are affected by riverine flooding. Nineteen (19) students between the ages of fifteen (15) and seventeen (17) were enrolled in WCDR in SIDS. 

Project Goals and Objectives
WCDR in SIDS sought to provide the students with an understanding of GIS concepts and its applications in disaster risk reduction and strengthening the resilience of women and girls to natural disasters and other crises. The program sought to ensure that at its conclusion, the trainees had a comprehensive understanding of:
Disaster and risk management, mitigation strategies and ways of building the disaster resilience capacity of women and girls.
Hazard vulnerability.
The vulnerabilities of women and girls during natural disasters and learn how to strengthen their resilience. 
The fundamentals of GIS and its uses in disaster risk management.
Project Approach, Activities & Results
The WCDR in SIDS Program was executed in two phases:

Describe the context (location), problem (what is the data or capacity gap), who identified the problem, data or capacity gap. (local stakeholder, intended data use, etc). 100-200 words. 
What was the original situation that needed to be solved?
How was it impacting people’s lives?

Approach (150-250 words)

What were the activities or methodologies conducted? How did HOT and the community create and use the data, dashboard, or other tools through the project?

What methodologies did we use? 
Training
Remote mapping
Other: Dignity Bag

Phase 1- Training
The WCDR in SIDS project team developed a comprehensive and targeted curriculum and training plan. (See Appendix A). The training plan covered basic GIS concepts and applications, the use of open mapping tools and techniques, risk management and gender-based disaster-resilience concepts. The project team delivered the content using a multi-modal approach. Every Saturday from April 29th to June 3rd, the project team delivered in-person lectures on-site at the PGHC. These sessions began at 9am and concluded at 1:30pm. Each week, the trainees were tasked with completing the modules via the Caribbean School of Data’s (CSOD) online Learning Management System. (LMS). Their performance was monitored by the Project Lead via the CSOD’s off-platform dashboard. 



Phase 2- Project Execution
The trainees were engaged in two projects throughout the program. The first was a design challenge executed upon completion of Module 1- Disaster Management. The trainees were challenged to work in teams of 5 to design a Dignity Bag. The final design was approved by the project team and re-created by the GISSTT and distributed to the trainees upon completion of Project 2.

Project 2 was entitled Girls Mapping for Disaster Resilience (GMDR). The aim of GMDR was to apply the trainees’ local knowledge of Penal/Debe to identify and map infrastructure and available resources within the project area using HOTOSM’s Tasking Manager. This project was executed on the final day of the project under the supervision of the project team and the GISSTT Executive. 

The GMDR Project took 3 hours to complete. GISSTT President, Shane Ragbir, introduced the project to the trainees and guided them through the mapping. The GISSTT President then lead a data validation exercise to validate the mapped points.
Communication & Stakeholder Engagement

What tools were used - and what do the tools do, provide links etc
Tasking Manager
FMTM
Map Roulette 
Other mobile apps, etc 
What datasets were collected, etc.
Specify OSM (buildings, roads, infrastructure, etc)
Mention other datasets as needed that were used (ie flood analysis) or collected 
What collaborations did we use and what community partner orgs played a major role, etc. 


Outcome and Impact (50-100 words, table or diagram if applicable)

MERL stats - how much of each dataset was created (ie 1,000 buildings), trainings run, etc. 
How the data was used in decision-making
# of Women trained: 17
# building added to the Tasking Manager: 1481
# Edits: 1719
Km Roads: 32
Lessons learned/next steps (optional)

Is there work still to be done? Ongoing support for the community or partner? Will this work be scaled up or replicated elsewhere?

Why did this approach work well in this context, what didn’t work well, what would advice be for people implementing similar projects
During the Tasking Manager training executed by HOTOSM, the trainees were engaged in a brief field mapping exercise. This activity was well-received by the trainees. Should this program be replicated, more field mapping will be incorporated into the curriculum. Consent to be taken on the field would therefore need to be obtained from the trainees’ parents or guardians. 
Should the training by replicated in other schools, the GISSTT will consider executing the program earlier in the semester or during the two-month July/August vacation period to ensure that the training does not conflict with the school’s examination period. 
Should the CSOD’s platform be utilized again, the GISSTT will attempt to engage with the CSOD to ensure that on-boarding onto the platform gets done earlier and that there are no technical issues on either end. 


Suggested Media (optional)

Image of people doing data collection, map of data added to OSM (recommended), maps used in project, links to external products etc 

Call to action (optional)






Upon conclusion of the GMDR Project, all trainees were made honorary Student Members of the GISSTT. They have access to information and resources to assist them in their School Based Assessments (SBAs) and future projects. The PGHC will also embark upon a “train the trainer” program in which Ms. Bhimsingh will introduce GIS applications and Tasking Manager to other teachers at the school with the intention of incorporating GIS into the school’s curriculum.
