date: 2024-02-02 01:36:00 Z
Project Summary Text: After Hurricane Otis struck Acapulco, HOT worked with local,
  national, and international partners, managing exhanges of post-disasters  drone
  imagery and pre-desasters satelite imagery  to map 52,000 buildings and identify
  5,439 damaged structures. Lessons learned highlight the importance of aligning mapping
  with evolving response and reconstruction needs. Community-driven initiatives, backed
  by various stakeholders, are addressing challenges for a sustainable recovery.

## **CONTEXT**
[Hurricane Otis](https://reliefweb.int/report/mexico/mexico-hurricane-otis-dref-operational-update-mdrmx005), a formidable Category 5 storm, struck Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, on October 25, 2023, unleashing devastating winds and torrential rains. This catastrophic event caused extensive damage, including the collapse of buildings and infrastructure, displacement of populations and loss of life. The aftermath left Acapulco in urgent need of comprehensive recovery efforts. The local government response, while immediate, lacked detailed geospatial data, crucial for effective reconstruction planning, and data management coordination capabilities. Recognizing this data gap, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and community institutions initiated a project to address the critical need for accurate mapping and information. The absence of accurate geospatial data hindered targeted relief efforts, affecting the lives of those affected and the recovery of basic services and economic activity by impeding damage assessments and the efficient allocation of resources and delaying order and reconstruction efforts. The delay in operations also fostered the generalization of a complex situation of violence in the area.

## **APPROACH**

The project employed drone imagery, OpenStreetMap, and KoboToolbox for data collection, ensuring a multi-faceted approach. Collaboration with the National Center for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED), the state of Guerrero, Civil Protection and UNICEF, [Help-NGO](https://www.help.ngo/), CEMEFI, and academic institutions, including Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Unidad Cuajimalpa, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, Universidad de Guanajuato, Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez, and Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, ensured comprehensive data coverage and the attempt to strengthen a permanent network of actors for the future reconstruction of Acapulco and future disasters. Facing challenges in connecting with local authorities, creative solutions were implemented, such as leveraging university networks. Valuable lessons were learned, highlighting the critical need for timely and relevant data during emergency situations.

In the detailed mapping of facilities, pre- and post-disaster buildings, the focus on educational institutions, health facilities and public markets provided a holistic view of the infrastructure landscape, as well as estimates of affected populations that supported targeted interventions and recovery planning.

## **OUTCOME AND IMPACT**

The project successfully mapped over **52,000 buildings**, **639 km of roads**, and **identified 5,439 damaged structures**. Educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and markets were thoroughly mapped, offering a detailed inventory for informed decision-making. Ongoing efforts include estimating population affectation and collaborating on economic revitalization and reforestation projects.

As part of the outcomes, the mapping initiative covered over **700 educational institutions in Acapulco de Juárez**, incorporating data from DENUE and local authorities, spanning central and peripheral locations. Additionally, **170 healthcare centers in Acapulco de Juárez and Coyuca de Benítez** and all **53 public markets** mentioned in the National Statistical Directory of Economic Units (DENUE) were thoroughly mapped.

## **LESSONS LEARNED**

Key lessons include the importance of rapid response, early coordination with imagery agencies, matching mapping efforts to changing reconstruction needs, and building lasting partnerships with local communities and authorities. Continued engagement with universities fosters a skilled volunteer base. New challenges, such as infectious outbreaks, economic recovery and reforestation, will be addressed in the future, demonstrating the project's resilience in the post-disaster phase.																							

The humanitarian program of HOT's LAC Hub is committed to long-term coordination and active participation in the reconstruction efforts in Acapulco and the early building of coordination channels with the main authorities in the different countries of the region, contributing to the resilient and sustainable reconstruction of at-risk areas.
