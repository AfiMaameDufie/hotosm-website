Across urban areas of Somalia a rough estimate of 3,700 metric tons of solid waste is generated each day. Mogadishu, the largest urban center and a safe haven for internally displaced persons as a result of cyclical floods, droughts and a locust outbreak has an arbitrary solid waste management program lacking a strategic framework to meet the demands of its growing urban population. 

While the government of Somalia regularly contracts private sector firms for solid waste management, and has witnessed some level of citizen mobilization and support, it still lacks the rigorous ability to regulate, monitor, improve and hold accountable all actors engaged in a systematic solid waste management response.

HOT, together with Spatial Collective and OSM Somalia are identifying the formal and informal disposal sites in Mogadishu in order to support solid waste management efforts in Mogadishu. The consortium conducted a remote mapping campaign where we redigitized all buildings in the city to get an updated basemap, conducted Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) in all districts to capture information on a selection of qualitative questions that will contribute to the knowledge on solid waste management in Mogadishu and will conduct sampled field data collection from the responses obtained in the FGDs. 

The FGDs will also be used at the end of data collection, to act as data validation exercises to ensure that the data is correct and accepted by the community.
