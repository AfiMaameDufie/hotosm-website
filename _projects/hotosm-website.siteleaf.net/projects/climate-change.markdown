### Flooding

* **Liberia**

WNAH Hub is tracking the flood in Liberia to promote anticipation as the countries of the Gulf of Guinea are exposed to devastating floods and rains.
WNAH has addressed data gaps for the preparedness and response efforts of critical stakeholders working on climate effects and sustainable communities. Partnerships between key stakeholders, including government officials and development actors, have been established. By documenting the vulnerability, risks, exposure, and hazards through focus group discussions and data collection, we identified the gaps hindering the effectiveness of Disaster Agencies and the Red Cross in designing awareness and response efforts. The project encompassed 38 towns spread across 4 clans in the Commonwealth district, covering a total land area of 391.377 square kilometers, with 30,000 inhabitants. We successfully trained 75 people, added 18,880 building footprints and 251 kilometers of unpaved roads to the OpenStreetMap (OSM), benefiting five districts. The Commonwealth district has over 2,992 essential facilities, including amenities, healthcare centers, water points, public restrooms, educational institutions, financial and commercial establishments, fish production and storage facilities, waste disposal sites, markets, and burial sites.
