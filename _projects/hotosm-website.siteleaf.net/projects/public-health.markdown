Access to quality healthcare for women and children remains a major challenge in the West Africa region, and Senegal is no exception. To promote access to women's healthcare, the **Sunu Weer Gui Yaram** project targets the **Matam Region** as a hard-to-reach part of the country that also experiences limited health services. Through national and local authorities, OSM Senegal and Marie Stopes as critical partners implemented the project through consultations, workshops, remote mapping, and field data collection.  The project promoted, enlightened, and provided reliable information on the situation of access, supply, maintenance, and overall infrastructure of the health facilities across the Matam Region in Senegal and 93,286 Buildings, 207 amenities have been added to OSM, 33 people have been trained and 10 thematics maps have been produced.
