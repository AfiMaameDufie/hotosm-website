title: GAZA BUILDING FOOTPRINTS PRE-CONFLICT UPDATE 2024
date: 2024-10-15 16:16:00 Z
published: false
Project Summary Text: 'Escalation of conflict in Gaza, starting in October 2023, resulted
  in a prolonged humanitarian crisis. Initially, understanding the impact of the conflict
  on existing buildings was challenging because pre-existing datasets from AI/ML models
  and OSM were not complete. In response, HOT coordinated a remote mapping campaign
  with expert OSM volunteers using HOT’s Tasking Manager.  Using pre-October 2023
  imagery, this effort added a net total of 59,223 buildings to the dataset and improved
  thousands of existing features through 469,152 map edits. '

*##  Background*

In areas impacted by conflict, remote damage analyses rely on pre-conflict building footprints to put in context the damage, or rubble, detected by earth observation. When conflict increased in Gaza in 2023, damage analysts began to compile multiple data sources for a pre-conflict building footprints dataset in Gaza, but no building dataset was complete.  The high density of buildings and the inability to safely gather on-the-ground information compounded challenges for accurate information. In such hard-to-reach areas, HOT’s remote, crowdsourced, and volunteer mapping methodology proved effective in efficiently collecting detailed buildings information visible on aerial imagery.


*##  Mapping Campaign: Gaza Update 2024*

Following consultation with humanitarian analysts, NGOs, and UN partners, HOT coordinated the creation of all building footprints in the Gaza in OSM, pre conflict. HOT’s [community of expert OpenStreetMap volunteers](https://www.hotosm.org/community/) and data validators completed all the data [work](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Gaza_Update_2024), coordinating through HOT’s [Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/). OSM documentation can be found ~[here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Gaza_Update_2024)~. The volunteers meticulously added missing buildings and improved existing data. 

Living by~[HOT’s data principles](https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data/data-principles/)~, all data work, especially in conflict zones, must balance usefulness with possible risks and mitigations. As in other areas that are hard to reach due to conflict, HOT balanced the data needs with [responsible data practices](https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data/data-principles/) based on the context. In this case, only expert HOT volunteers were assigned to Tasking Manager in Gaza to address data quality and protection concerns.

*##  Project Outcomes*

A net total of 59,223 buildings were added to the OSM buildings dataset in Gaza, and thousands of existing building geometries (shapes) were improved. All of Gaza was also verified by a human familiar with OSM building guidelines for data quality checks. The resulting dataset has 18% more buildings than the leading dataset by Microsoft, created by machine learning (as of September 2024). 
The updated OSM data in Gaza is live in OpenStreetMap and available via ~[HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_pse_buildings?)~ or ~[HOT’s Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org/v3/).~ The data is being used now by humanitarian conflict researchers and information management NGOs to create more accurate damage estimates and plan for humanitarian response.

*## What’s Next?*

Remote mapping work and HOT’s Conflict and Displacement Program leads the way for us to fill humanitarian data gaps in conflict areas by mapping pre-conflict baselines for infrastructure. When all buildings in conflict zones are reflected in one pre-conflict dataset, data analysts can track which buildings are functional and which are destroyed. Eventually, we will be able to track demolition and rebuilding when the context allows.

*##  Get Involved*

HOT welcomes data requests from the humanitarian community and will aim to balance requests with anticipated usefulness, available resources, and protection issues to address humanitarian data gaps in conflict zones worldwide.
