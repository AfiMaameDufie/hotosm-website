Project Summary Text: "**Background**\nMost countries in the Latin America region
  have official national cartographies that are incomplete, outdated, and unequal
  across their entire territory. This means that many localities that tend to be the
  most vulnerable and isolated do not have any cartography at all. This in turn has
  a negative impact on territorial planning quality and capacity to be evidence-based
  as well as the development of public policies for the benefit of these populations.\n\n**Summary**\nThis
  project builds upon our work over the past two years with municipal and national
  governments, where we've collaboratively built local cartographies, technical competencies
  in the localities (governments, organizations and universities), and support networks
  installed with universities. During this project, the focus will be on offering
  trainings for selected municipal governments throughout the region in partnership
  with the Open Government Partnership (OGP) network. \n\nThrough this project, with
  public participation, the data creation and systems updates will generate experiences
  and networks in these cities that will be the basis for inclusive planning subsequently
  bolstering the living conditions of many communities that have been ignored until
  now.\n\n**Approach**\nWe will create a network with an initial group of selected
  municipalities within the Open Government Partnership network. The municipalities
  will be selected based on their level of need and priority for disaster risk issues,
  their commitment to follow an intensive one-term training, and their previous linkage
  with local universities to build a permanent relationship of support for students
  in careers related to territorial management."

Through our Mapping for Climate Ready Cities program, HOT is mapping cities in four priority regions across the world and developing a thriving ecosystem to create, interpret, and use maps to respond to and reduce climate risks in densely populated urban areas.
