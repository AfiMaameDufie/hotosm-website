## Background
Most countries in the Latin America region have official national cartographies that are incomplete, outdated, and unequal across their entire territory. This means that many localities that tend to be the most vulnerable and isolated do not have any cartography at all. This in turn has a negative impact on territorial planning quality and capacity to be evidence-based as well as the development of public policies for the benefit of these populations.

## Summary
This project builds upon our work over the past two years with municipal and national governments, where we've collaboratively built local cartographies, technical competencies in the localities (governments, organizations and universities), and support networks installed with universities. During this project, the focus will be on offering trainings for selected municipal governments throughout the region in partnership with the Open Government Partnership (OGP) network. 

Through this project, with public participation, the data creation and systems updates will generate experiences and networks in these cities that will be the basis for inclusive planning subsequently bolstering the living conditions of many communities that have been ignored until now.

## Approach
We will create a network with an initial group of selected municipalities within the Open Government Partnership network. The municipalities will be selected based on their level of need and priority for disaster risk issues, their commitment to follow an intensive one-term training, and their previous linkage with local universities to build a permanent relationship of support for students in careers related to territorial management.
