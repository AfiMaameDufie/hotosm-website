We face multiple, ongoing crises whose severity will be exacerbated by COVID-19. These crises include those trapped by or displaced by conflict and living in close surroundings like refugee camps or informal settlements and populations with extreme/additional vulnerability e.g. TB and HIV/AIDs, where social distancing may not be possible.

As the crisis scales globally, it is more important than ever to understand that the 1 billion people living in places that are partially or completely unmapped face increased risks. They may be left out of life-saving measures, access to healthcare and other forms of support. The ability of local and national governments to anticipate and plan for response needs, including testing, treatment, contact tracing is seriously hindered by the lack of reliable maps.

Due to the scale and unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 crisis, we at HOT find ourselves in new territory and are adapting our response to the rapidly changing needs on the ground. However, in addition to creating data, consideration for the way that data will be used is paramount if it is to be effective.

**HOTâ€™s response will focus on three areas:**

**1. Helping government agencies and responders**\
Given the rapid spread of the crisis, it is crucial to get OpenStreetMap data into the hands of government agencies/health authorities and other actors requesting it for the response. We are working with the [UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian data](https://data.humdata.org/event/covid-19) to provide daily map exports in hardest hit locations on HDX, and to provide remote training, support and analysis to governments and CSOs/NGOs.

In many countries, the outbreak has caused restrictions on movement that are affecting livelihoods and the need to plan for cash-based interventions (e.g. cash assistance) in rural and under-mapped areas. Maps are required in order to identify where vulnerable populations are and provide this information to government teams, and to provide them a way to track and visualize their progress. This work is starting in Peru immediately, with projects available for mapping and validation: [Contribute](https://tasks.hotosm.org/contribute?difficulty=ALL&campaign=COVID-19) here.

**2.** **Identifying populations most at risk**\
Identifying gaps, such as the need for disaggregated data on where the most vulnerable live (e.g. 60\+ population, prevalence of pre-existing conditions such as HIV/AIDS), any missing data on health infrastructure such as facilities, testing sites, pharmacies, laboratories, etc., is needed. We will also need to consider missing data on resource distribution centers, such as markets and food centers, to understand how resources are allocated and where those in need are gathering. We will also focus on mapping as well as place names and administrative boundaries. It will also be necessary to re-prioritize existing mapping projects in high risk areas and tag as COVID-19 in [Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) to direct mappers to the most urgent projects.

3\. **Mapping in places most at risk**\
Working with local data communities already solving the real needs of the local response using OpenStreetMap, we plan to fund local mapping communities by providing HOT Emergency Microgrants in order to support and scale up mapping efforts that have been identified as urgent.

HOT works to ensure map data should be accessible and used in decisions that save and improve lives, and that everyone can engage and contribute to the map. The scale of the need we are facing with COVID-19 is truly unprecedented. A flexible, considered approach that enables vulnerable communities and essential services to be mapped, and gets maps into the hands of those who need them, is our highest priority.

**Global solidarity is essential to tackling a global pandemic. To get involved:**
