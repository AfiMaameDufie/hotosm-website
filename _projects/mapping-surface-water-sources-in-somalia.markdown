Droughts in Somalia have wreaked havoc on communities, causing severe water shortages, crop failures, and livestock deaths, impacting over 3.2 million people across 66 districts. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicts a 66% likelihood that La Niña will intensify during September-October-November, with a 74% chance of persisting into 2025. This phenomenon, marked by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, is exacerbating global weather patterns, particularly in the Greater Horn of Africa, where it increases the risk of below-normal rainfall and prolonged dry spells in Somalia.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) emphasizes the urgent need for early warnings and anticipatory actions to safeguard lives and livelihoods from extreme weather events driven by La Niña. In this context, mapping surface water catchments becomes crucial. Accurate and up-to-date data empower communities and authorities to monitor water availability, identify vulnerable areas, and implement timely interventions to mitigate the impacts of drought. Proactive water resource management enables Somalia to better prepare for and respond to the dry conditions induced by La Niña, ultimately protecting livelihoods and ensuring water security.

**Anticipatory action**

To address the ongoing crisis, [FAO’s Somalia](https://www.fao.org/somalia/en/) Water and Land Information Management ([SWALIM](https://www.faoswalim.org/)) has partnered with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap - Eastern and Southern Africa hub (HOT ESA) to map surface water sources in Somalia. This mapping campaign involving volunteer mappers across the world, focuses on identifying and documenting key surface water sources, such as natural ponds, Hafir dams, and Berkards, to strengthen drought preparedness and emergency response efforts. The data collected will be integrated into FAO's early warning system, helping to alert communities at risk of drought. Additionally, other humanitarian organizations will use this data to protect lives and livelihoods during drought response activities in the country.

**How to get involved**

To remotely map water reservoirs, we will utilize the HOT Tasking Manager and JOSM. The HOT ESA team will provide weekly training sessions for volunteers, including participants from Somalia who bring valuable local knowledge. Expert mappers will oversee quality control to ensure accuracy. The dataset will be mapped in OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform.

If you're new to mapping and want to learn or improve your skills, we're hosting weekly virtual Mapathon Trainings.** Sign up here.**
The campaign will run from August 29th to November 2024; mappers who take part from the start until the end of the campaign will receive a certificate.
