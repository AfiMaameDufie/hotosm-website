Project Summary Text: 'With support from the H2H Network, HOT is working with partners
  to improve spatial data in Khartoum and other conflict-impacted areas in Sudan.
  By collaborating with humanitarian networks and local and regional OSM communities,
  HOT is developing a responsible data approach to fill spatial data gaps through
  participatory approaches. The leading data gaps of focus are  accurate roads and
  populated areas, which are needed for aid delivery planning. '

##  Background*

Now in its second year, the civil war in Sudan has led to deteriorating humanitarian conditions. As of September 2024, Sudan is facing the world’s highest displacement, and millions face inadequate food, health, and other basic services and protection ([IOM](https://www.iom.int/news/sudan-internal-displacement-set-top-10-million-famine-looms-iom#:~:text=IOM's%20Displacement%20Tracking%20Matrix%2C%20which,war%2C%20and%207.1%20million%20since.)). The mounting crisis with inadequate funding makes it critical for data and maps to be available to all humanitarian responders, saving on time and resources to plan for adequate aid delivery. 

##  Participatory Mapping*

Guided by [HOT’s data principles](https://www.hotosm.org/tools-and-data/data-principles/), and with~[support from H2H](https://h2hnetwork.org/h2hsupport-package-conflict-sudan)~, HOT is working with regional OSM communities and humanitarian partners to improve spatial data for the road network and populated places.   

Currently, [HOT exports 11 datasets from OpenStreetMap to HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/?groups=sdn&organization=hot&q=&sort=last_modified%20desc&ext_page_size=25) for Sudan, and provides for custom exports from OSM through [HOT’s Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org/v3/). Most of the spatial datasets for Sudan still need improvements. To improve data for humanitarian use, and allow for more evidence based decisions, HOT will harness participatory mapping power to address data quality issues and data gaps. Work will include:

1 Enhancing roads networks .This involves updating and validating road network data to reflect current conditions

⠀
2 Validating and enriching data on populated places  to aid resource allocation and humanitarian planning.
