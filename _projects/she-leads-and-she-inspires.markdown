The Open Mapping Hub Asia Pacific (the Hub) is committed to supporting the emergence and evolution of women leaders within the OSM ecosystem and beyond. Towards that commitment, the Hub launched She Leads and She Inspires, a training and professional development opportunity that aims to support women to become OSM community leaders, gaining skills in geospatial data and technologies, decision making, digital leadership, needs identification, and team building.

The program was designed with, by, and for women in (or hoping to step into!) leadership roles within their communities.
