## Summary
Dhaka is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. With such rapid urbanization, Dhaka confronts unique challenges in population density that places immense strain on urban infrastructure, including but not limited to: public health centers and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) services, housing, and disaster response capabilities. Moreover, vulnerable communities mainly in slums or informal settlements are threatened by increasingly frequent and intense climate-related issues. The Open Mapping for Resilience project will address these challenges through the establishment of a comprehensive geospatial database in OpenStreetMap that will enable humanitarian organizations, local authorities as well as communities to prepare, respond to, adapt and transform the urban infrastructure in Dhaka.

## Background
Dhaka’s growing migration has led to a rapid expansion of slums and informal settlements resulting in makeshift communities and poor urban planning. These areas have become highly susceptible to climate-related and man-made hazards, such as: flooding, water-logging, fire, disease outbreaks, and urban heat waves. This is further compounded by existing social and infrastructural vulnerabilities, such as: poor housing conditions and limited access to healthcare, sanitation, and waste management services.

These settlements are therefore unable to capture the benefits of urban agglomeration. With a soaring youth population, it will be critical in the coming decades to develop a strong geospatial database to understand changing population dynamics and needs amidst these increasingly frequent challenges. The open-source geospatial database will be a necessary foundation for a better and more systematic urban planning system. This would include equipping the youth with digital skills in mapping and analyzing data on sectors including urban planning, healthcare, governance, and education. As the Bangladeshi government pushes for a digital nation with improved digital access and literacy, through the AP Hub, HOT can be instrumental in supporting these efforts, especially as the country’s graduates from its Least Developed Country (LDC) status.

## Approach
In order to support the urban development for future sustainable and climate-resilient cities across the Asia-Pacific region, the AP Hub aims to build community knowledge and data flows by catalyzing open data ecosystems where local government, INGO, NGO, private sector, academia, and community actors come together to map both the most essential and critical features of the developing cities of Asia-Pacific. 

### Methodology
The project will address data gaps with partners, local communities, and stakeholders through remote mapping and validation campaigns. This will be followed by field data collection and mapping campaigns focusing on the most vulnerable slums and informal settlements. 

The data collection and awareness building efforts will be supported by stakeholder trainings, workshops, and upskilling efforts focusing on data collection and data use for decision making.


### Datasets Collected
* Base data (roads, buildings, water bodies, land use) 
* More detailed data model to be developed with co-creation workshops with local stakeholders


### Expected Outcome and Impact
Catalyzing a vibrant, sustainable, multi-actor open data ecosystem in the cities, the AP Hub aims to create comprehensive and up-to-date geospatial data on OSM that will empower humanitarian organizations, local authorities, and grassroot communities to better understand, plan for, and respond to various challenges, including the adverse effects of climate change, natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other urban development needs. Ultimately, the AP Hub hopes to contribute to the overall goal of urban resilience against climate change and disasters.
