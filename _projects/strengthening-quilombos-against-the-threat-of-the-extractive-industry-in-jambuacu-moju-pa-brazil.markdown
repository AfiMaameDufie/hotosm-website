In the region of Moju-PA, Brazil, lie the Quilombola communities of Jambuaçu. These communities, part of the Northeast Region which houses 69.19% of Brazil's Quilombolas, are fiercely fighting for their land rights against formidable challenges, particularly from the palm oil industry. Quilombolas in Brazil are Afro-descendants who live in communities reminiscent of the ancient quilombos—settlements originally formed by people who escaped slavery during the colonial era and kept African ways of living and culture alive. Known for their agricultural activities, these communities are marked by their ongoing political and territorial struggles.\
\
Recognizing the critical role of mapping for these communities, especially in the ongoing recognition and land titling processes in Pará, the Girls of Geo group has spearheaded remote and collaborative mapping actions in Moju-PA with the support of the Open Mapping Hub in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC Hub). This effort, supported by various organizations, has already made significant progress in mapping Quilombola territories and access roads, enhancing visibility and supporting conservation efforts. The project also focuses on community strengthening through workshops on mapping platforms and geotechnological tools. The project draws on the principles of counter-mapping, which emphasize community strengthening and challenge dominant mapping practices. It aligns with initiatives such as the New Social Cartography of the Amazon project, which prioritize community participation in mapping processes. By amplifying Quilombola voices and perspectives, the project aims to create more inclusive and accurate representations of territory and identity.\
\
The project utilizes participatory geospatial mapping, collaborative cartography, and digital technologies to collect and analyze data. It combines high-resolution satellite imagery with field surveys and community input to create detailed maps of Quilombola territories. Workshops and training sessions ensure community engagement and capacity building, while adherence to ethical standards and data privacy regulations is maintained throughout the process.\
\
The project also leverages partnerships with organizations such as Instituto Federal do Pará - IFPA and the Perpetuar Project. By engaging Quilombola communities and leveraging technological tools, the project aims to counteract invisibility and support sustainable resource management.The project will result in the creation of detailed digital and printed maps of Quilombola territories, accessible through platforms like OpenStreetMap and Umap. These maps will include boundary delineations, access routes, and key environmental features, providing valuable information for conservation and sustainable management efforts. Additionally, the project aims to strengthen Quilombola communities to advocate for their rights and protect their territories through increased visibility and awareness.\
\
The project will significantly advance the mapping of Quilombola territories and access roads, enhancing visibility and supporting conservation efforts. This initiative is not just about mapping; it aims to enable communities through workshops on mapping platforms and tools, aiding in territorial demarcation and fostering a sense of ownership, agency, and resilience among the Quilombola communities of Jambuaçu.Instituto Federal do Pará - IFPA\
