##Background

Road networks play a crucial role in supporting economic and humanitarian activities within societies. In rural areas, roads are paramount for enhancing accessibility, fostering economic development, and promoting social integration. Improved road infrastructure also facilitates easier access to essential services like healthcare, education, and markets.

Currently, the rural regions of Nepal face a lack of reliable road network data. Moreover, existing poor-quality OSM road network data can result in inaccurate routing. Additionally, inaccurate and inaccessible data can also slow down or impede effective humanitarian aid during emergencies.
While OSM allows actors, such as local governments, to add missing features, rectify and update data in OSM, knowledge on OSM in the region is still limited. It is critical that the local stakeholders are trained on OSM, so that they can (1) leverage it to inform their decision-making; (2) maintain and update OSM data to support local development and humanitarian efforts.

Approach (150-250 words) | Co-Designing, Capacity Building, and Networking

What methodologies did we use? 
The project co-designed and implemented the following workflow with local stakeholders, including Start Network and KIRDARC:
The foundational phase improved and reviewed the OSM road data with local stakeholders to understand their needs, gaps, and challenges.
The project planning phase was co-created with local stakeholders, and priority open-mapping capacities were identified to be developed.
The building local capacities phase worked with key local stakeholders, such as KIRDARC and local government representatives, through trainings and hands-on practice on the grounded foundational dataset.
The building networks phase provided local stakeholders opportunities to network with the wider OSM Nepal Community for future collaborations.

 AP Hub co-designed workflow with local stakeholders that is tailored to the local Karnali Province context.

What tools were used - and what do the tools do, provide links etc

Tasking Manager and MapRoulette were used to update and prepare validated OSM maps for review. OSMAnd, Organic Maps, and BRouter were used to conduct local validation of updated road network OSM data. Ushahidi was used to report local road closures (e.g. from landslides) that can be captured and updated on OSM.

What datasets were collected, etc.

Roads, buildings, and critical infrastructures such as health posts, water sources, schools, evacuation centers, etc. 

Outcome and Impact | Empowering Communities through Open Data
 (50-100 words, table or diagram if applicable)

In the long-tem, it is expected that the validated road network data will enable humanitarian and development actors to effectively reach communities that were previously uncharted on the map. 

Through the project, a series of technical workshops and training were conducted for the participating Start Network member organizations and volunteers on OpenStreetMap, field mapping and data analysis and creation using open source tools. OSM experts were also mobilized nationally to support data quality and validation efforts during this project.

In the short-term, local stakeholders, including community members, have acquired the necessary open-mapping skills to actively participate in mapping and validation activities, especially to reflect changes in the road network accessibility. Local stakeholders also have access to the project OSM Wikipage and the training materials covered, allowing them to review as they practice the skills. In addition, the open data will be fully available for local stakeholders, such as other NGOs, to use for their own initiatives.

Through the project, the region has seen an average of 44.17% increase in road network OSM data, through the mapping and validation efforts led by AP Hub (see figs. below). The project has involved 140 unique mappers and trained 161 persons, of which included 16 government representatives.
