The campaign mobilises the open mapping community to put amenities used by women and girls in communities across East and Southern Africa on the map (although everyone is welcome regardless of their location!)

This can include health facilities, schools, childcare, police stations and much more. A [full data model is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIaYkWQlxq-E6ofRrvYdXageqWJCkSMGSi2CicLU5wM/edit?usp=sharing)!

We hope that by putting these vital amenities on the map that we can improve access to services, visualise what is available and help people advocate for increased and improved services.

The campaign centres on [the EveryDoor app](https://every-door.app/) (available on iOS and Android). EveryDoor is an OpenStreetMap editor specifically for adding and editing points of interest and other amenities.

**If you want to get involved or get in touch:**

Firstly, you can start mapping! Download or open every door and improve the data in your neighbourhood.

You can also join the #MapHerWorld [whatsapp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Dl7UeKmH9mZ3csygQxcwJT) to get updates, ask questions and share your experience.
