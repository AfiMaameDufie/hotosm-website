The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is highly vulnerable to natural hazards and volatile weather conditions, a situation exacerbated by high population density and climate change. In the 20 year period from 1998 to 2017, LAC was home to five of the top 10 countries most devastated by these events. Many Caribbean islands and coastal Central American countries suffer from recurring hurricanes, tropical cyclones, landslides and flooding.

Following on the [Open Cities Africa ](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/open-cities-africa-accra-city-project-ghana/)experience, HOT is proud to announce the extension of the program to open mapping of resilience needs and response capacities with the Open Cities Latin America and the Caribbean project in collaboration with the [Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/en)(GFDRR) and [SwissRE Foundation](https://www.swissrefoundation.org/our-work/focus-area/natural-hazard-and-climate-risk-management/Open_mapping_for_resilient_societies_.html).

## Open Cities: Guatemala

Guatemala's economic and social development is regularly affected by the effects of climate change, natural disasters phenomena such as floods and droughts, which are expected to increase in both frequency and intensity. The impact of these events is particularly challenging for the most vulnerable members of the population. The occurrence of frequent natural disasters generates significant emergency care needs and as a result complicates the government's efforts to address the challenges of reducing poverty and inequality.

Mexico has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In preparation for the [Climate Action Plan](https://www.gob.mx/sedatu/documentos/estrategia-nacional-de-ordenamiento-territorial-de-la-sedatu-2020-2040), the aim is to build effective synergies between local and national stakeholders. This will help identify, analyze, evaluate, and prioritize city-level climate change mitigation and adaptation actions with active stakeholder engagement.
