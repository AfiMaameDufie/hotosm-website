The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is highly vulnerable to natural hazards and volatile weather conditions, a situation exacerbated by high population density and climate change. In the 20 year period from 1998 to 2017, LAC was home to five of the top 10 countries most devastated by these events. Many Caribbean islands and coastal Central American countries suffer from recurring hurricanes, tropical cyclones, landslides and flooding.

Following on the [Open Cities Africa ](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/open-cities-africa-accra-city-project-ghana/)experience, HOT is proud to announce the extension of the program to open mapping of resilience needs and response capacities with the Open Cities Latin America and the Caribbean project in collaboration with the [Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/en)(GFDRR) and [SwissRE Foundation](https://www.swissrefoundation.org/our-work/focus-area/natural-hazard-and-climate-risk-management/Open_mapping_for_resilient_societies_.html).
