Project Summary Text: "The project in Indonesia has transformed lives by training
  over 90 individuals and mapping 900+ kilometers of roads, 90,000 buildings, and
  targeting 200+ households for polio immunization. This data enabled the Indonesian
  Red Cross to analyze polio immunization progress and prioritize health promotion
  efforts. This has empowered communities and improved access to essential services,
  making a tangible difference in people's daily lives. \n\n“The health facility coverage
  analysis map can be used to prioritize and determine areas for mobilizing health
  promotion efforts, especially targeted towards mothers with children” - Sheila Amalia
