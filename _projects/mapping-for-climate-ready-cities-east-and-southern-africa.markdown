Project Summary Text: |-
  Through our Mapping for Climate Ready Cities program, HOT is supporting the development of a thriving ecosystem focused on creation, interpretation, and use of maps to respond to and reduce climate risks in urban areas across four priority regions.


  This project page highlights our work in East and Southern Africa.

## Summary
The Mapping for Climate Ready Cities project in the East and Southern Africa Open Mapping Hub is focusing on cities in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Democratic Republic of the Congo. The team will use open mapping tools and technology to generate open map data in and around the major cities of Addis Ababa, Kinshasa, Nairobi and Nakuru to aid communities, governments, and NGOs in effectively planning and implementing city climate resiliency programs and creating awareness of how climate change is affecting urban dwellers.

## Background
Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo is a city that faces frequent wide-scale flooding caused by a multitude of factors. A number of humanitarian organizations have requested updated data to assist them in making informed decisions on tackling flooding scenarios in the city. 

In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as urbanization continues, there is a continued reduction of green spaces and insufficient road infrastructure. There are also data gaps in transportation planning, including comprehensive traffic flow studies, in-depth analysis of commuter patterns, non-motorized transport audits, road safety audits, and real-time monitoring of transportation systems. The lack of accurate and up-to-date information hampers effective decision-making for infrastructure development, planning, and traffic management.

In the city of Nakuru, Kenya, similar to Addis Ababa, the Nakuru City Council is looking to develop and implement a city wide mobility plan that will help support the increasing population size as well as create a city-wide flood resilient/sponge city plan. 

Nairobi, Kenya is also experiencing significant population growth. Together with the Nairobi County government, the team looks to tackle the inadequate service delivery in informal settlements in the city. According to the county government and local implementing organizations, informal settlements tend to be less developed with critical infrastructure and services due their unplanned nature. This makes access to critical services like health, education, etc. very expensive, or even non existent, in these areas. 

## Approach

### Methodology
Across these four cities, HOT plans to start with multiple stakeholder engagements in order to create awareness for the program. During that time, city wide remote mapping and validation campaigns using the tasking manager, maproullete and mapwith AI tools will be deployed and the remote mapping done by the Open mapping communities within the region. The ESA hub through this Spatial People Network and Open Mapping communities  plans to engagement over 300 volunteers across the region to remote and validate buildings, roads and add place names.

The teams also plans to deploy 10, 360 cameras across the Addis, Nairobi and Kinsasha to capture street level imagery using mapillary that will be used to add extra upto date details of infrastructure and services within major parts of the city. The team also plans to use field data collection applications that include opendata kit, field tasking manager to locate and map critical infrastructure and services within particular parts of the city.
 
With the generation of these open datasets, the team also plans to hold multiple participatory mapping sessions with major proogram stakeholders that will include city authorities, communities and NGOs to capture more indepth insights, perceptions and possible community solutions to tacke the identified issues. 
Using GIS tools like QGIS, R, google earth engine, the team plans to work with multitide of partners to analyse and develop information products that showcase the extent of cities climate related issues like transportation, heat waves, service delivery and disaster planning and response inorder to create awareness and possible solutions.


### Expected Outcome and Impact
Through the Mapping Climate Ready Cities Program, the team plans to map and validate a over 1million buildings, add over 5,000 place names onto OpenStreetmap and collect over 50,000 street level images across these cities.

The ESA team plans to engage 8 city and government agencies, work with 15 community and national organisations working in and around the cities as well as train and equip over 120 community, national and regional experts in the use of open mapping tools and technology inorder expand the knowledge and scale up the work beyond the initially identified cities in the region.
