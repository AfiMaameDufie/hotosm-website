### How to participate as a beginner mapper:
</div>
The best way to learn how to contribute to the response if you are a beginner is to join a community mapathon. You can find them on the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2023_Turkey_Earthquakes#Community_Mapathons) or on [the OSM calendar](https://osmcal.org/).

You can also contribute to the [MapRoulette challenges of Yer Çizenler](https://maproulette.org/browse/projects/51027) to tag the collapsed buildings from verified datasets. (Challenges not always available. Check back regularly.)

If there are not any MapRoulette challenges currently available, beginner mappers can watch this [video for tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbmcwMLhcwM) on how to contribute to the Tasking Manager projects for this response.

You can also find support and advice on the [HOTOSM slack channels](https://slack.hotosm.org/) for #disastermapping and #mappersupport
