### How to participate as a beginner mapper:

The best way to learn how to contribute to the response if you are a beginner is to join a community mapathon. You can find them on the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2023_Turkey_Earthquakes#Community_Mapathons) or on [the OSM calendar](https://osmcal.org/).

You can also contribute to the [MapRoulette challenges of Yer Çizenler](https://maproulette.org/browse/projects/51027) to tag the collapsed buildings from verified datasets. (Challenges not always available. Check back regularly.)

You can also find support and advice on the [HOTOSM slack channels](https://slack.hotosm.org/) for #disastermapping and #mappersupport

### If you are already an intermediate or advanced mapper...

The priorities for mapping on the HOT tasking manager are currently:

* [M7.8 EARTHQUAKE TÜRKIYE, KAHRAMANMARAŞ](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14262)

* [MISSING MAPS - EARTHQUAKE SYRIA, IDLIB DISTRICT (RURAL)](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14311)

### If you are already an experienced validator...

The priorities for validation on the HOT tasking manager are currently:

* [MISSING MAPS - EARTHQUAKE SYRIA, AFRIN DISTRICT](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14245)

* [M7.8 EARTHQUAKE TÜRKIYE, KILIS](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/14264)

If you are an advanced mapper and would like to join the HOT Global Validators Team, [please fill in your details here](http://bit.ly/HOTValidators).

### Where to find data:

* Download [datasets of the affected areas from HDX](https://data.humdata.org/event/turkiye-syria-earthquakes). Datasets are regularly updated with new data from the OSM mapping above.

Visit the [Turkey and Syria Earthquake Response Activation page](https://www.hotosm.org/disaster-services/turkiye-earthquakes-february-2023-activation/) for more details and statistics on the mapping response.
