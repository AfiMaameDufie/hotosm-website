## How to participate as a beginner mapper:
* The best way to learn how to contribute to the response if you are a beginner is to join a community mapathon. You can find them on the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2023_Turkey_Earthquakes#Community_Mapathons) or on [the OSM calendar](https://osmcal.org/).
* Use the [MapRoulette challenges of Yer Ã‡izenler](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/37609) to tag the collapsed buildings from verified datasets. (Challenges not always available. Check back regularly.)
* Join the [HOTOSM slack channels](https://slack.hotosm.org/) for #disastermapping and #mappersupport

## How to participate as an intermediate or advanced mapper:
* Map [tasks](https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore?campaign=Turkey%20and%20Syria%20Earthquake%20Response%20February%202023) on the Tasking Manager campaign for this response.

## Where to find data:
* Download [datasets of the affected areas from HDX](https://data.humdata.org/event/turkiye-syria-earthquakes). Datasets are regularly updated with new data from the OSM mapping above.
