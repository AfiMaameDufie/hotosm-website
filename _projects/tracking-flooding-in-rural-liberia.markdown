Project Summary Text: |
  The Commonwealth District in rural Liberia is home to Lake Piso, a crucial hub of biodiversity covering an area of 103 km2 and the Atlantic Ocean. However, heavy rainfall and high sea-level rise severely affect towns and villages along the lake's banks and coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  HOT's regional hub partnered with the government, local communities, and disaster resilience actors to generate vital, insightful datasets to support decision-making and derive mitigation programs. The projectâ€™s outputs empower response actors and local communities to develop resilience initiatives to reduce the devastating impact of flooding and sea-level rise over the past three decades. This is the first time such tools have been available to national emergency actors in Liberia.
