Hurricane John has severely impacted the Pacific coast, particularly the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca. With at least twelve fatalities and numerous homes destroyed, many communities have been cut off due to flooding and landslides. The urgency of mapping shelters and essential facilities is critical to coordinating rescue operations and ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches the most affected areas. This effort will help guarantee that vulnerable populations have timely access to vital resources and safe spaces.
