## CONTEXT

As of July 2024, both Hurricane Alberto and Hurricane Beryl are significantly impacting the Yucatán Peninsula, particularly in Quintana Roo. These hurricanes have prompted urgent alerts throughout the region, leading authorities to activate emergency shelters.

The combined effects of these hurricanes have caused substantial disruptions. Heavy rains and strong winds have resulted in flooding, causing widespread chaos and significant challenges.

In response, as part of the [Mapping for Climate Ready Cities Program](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/mapping-for-climate-ready-cities-latin-america/), the [Open Mapping Hub in Latin America and the Caribbean Hub](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/open-mapping-hub-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/) and [CoMapper](https://site.comapper.org/), in collaboration with the Quintana Roo Government, are calling on mappers with intermediate experience to participate in the emergency mapping activation on OpenStreetMap (OSM) in Quintana Roo. The primary objective will be to map temporary shelters following the passage of Hurricanes Alberto and Beryl.
