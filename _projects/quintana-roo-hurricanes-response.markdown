## [Wiki page for this activation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Open_Mapping_Hub_-_Latin_America_and_The_Caribbean/Activations/2024_Hurricane_Beryl_Response)

## CONTEXT

As of July 2024, both Tropical Storm Alberto and Hurricane Beryl are causing significant damage across the Caribbean, Venezuela, and Mexico. These natural hazards have prompted urgent alerts throughout the affected regions, leading authorities to activate emergency shelters to protect and assist the impacted populations.

The combined effects of these natural hazards have caused substantial disruptions. Heavy rains and strong winds have resulted in flooding, causing widespread chaos and significant challenges.

On July 2nd, as part of the [Mapping for Climate Ready Cities Program](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/mapping-for-climate-ready-cities-latin-america/), the [Open Mapping Hub in Latin America and the Caribbean Hub](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/open-mapping-hub-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/) and [CoMapper](https://site.comapper.org/), in collaboration with the Quintana Roo Government, are calling on mappers with intermediate experience to participate in the emergency mapping activation on OpenStreetMap (OSM) in Quintana Roo. The primary objective will be to map temporary shelters following the passage of Tropical Storm Alberto and Hurricane Beryl.

On July 4th, the scope of the activation has expanded to include mapping Campeche, Yucatan, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas in Mexico.

On July 9th, the LAC Hub is supporting anticipatory mapping efforts in the Eastern Caribbean Islands following the severe damage to infrastructure, services, and livelihoods in Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Jamaica.
