# Movement Building

## OSM Grants and Fellowships

The hub has embarked on a campaign to mobilize contributors in the region, through a test - learn - scale-up approach. Among the 24 countries, we opted to test a community-building approach in 10 countries. This approach is aimed at existing organizations promoting OSM, through a certified training course in the management of civil society organizations, followed by a grant of $10,000 each for 6 months. In addition, we have made available a research grant for 8 people, from 4 countries, to support the development of a community of researchers around OSM.

### WNAH-Open Mapping & Techdays(OMTD)

* **Ivory Coast**

Training on the usage of tools and technologies for contributing to OSM and reusing the data have been organized in Ivory Coast with over 30 participants from various sectors. Through a mapathon, the participants remotely mapped a city named OUANGOLO, located in the northern part of Côte d'Ivoire. They have mapped 8,379 buildings, 20 km of roads, and making a total of 361 changesets with 8,630 map edits.(more details here).The professors from Felix Houphouet-Boigny University who attended the training have decided to incorporate OSM into their geomatics curriculum, benefiting the students. Additionally, a participant from OMTD, residing in Korogho, a city in northern Côte d'Ivoire, initiated a program to train students from the University of Korogho. Twenty-five students underwent the training and launched a campaign to map water points in the city. This participant received the Mwalai grant to implement the program, in collaboration with OSMCI, thereby decentralizing OSM to other cities.

A. Diop. The OMTD event provided an opportunity to popularize open geospatial technologies and enhance the technical skills of the participants. At the end of OMTD, the participants were invited to join the WhatsApp group of the OSM West African community.
