## Canoa de Tolda: Preserving Communities Along the Rio Sao Francisco

![Canoa de Tolda](https://cdn.hotosm.org/website/IMG_1654+(1).jpg)

**Canoa de Tolda** is a traditional type of boat used in the lower basin of the Rio Sao Francisco. It is also the name of a small community NGO dedicated to helping people in the river valley affected by the changing behavior of the river due to climate change and water usage by the agro-industry and hydroelectric power.

The Canoa de Tolda project aims to empower the local population of the lower São Francisco river basin by gathering data that will, for the first time, enable collaborative digital modeling of high-precision terrain. This data will allow for the mapping of populations in areas at risk of flooding, with the goal of empowering them to defend their rights.

### The Impact of Climate Change in the Region
The region has been severely impacted by climate change, experiencing extreme periods of drought and flooding. Increasing frequency and intensity of droughts may turn perennial rivers into intermittent ones, and these intermittent rivers may disappear altogether. Additionally, heavy rains and poor urban planning put at risk the communities who rely on the river for their basic socio-economic activities.

### Partners Involved in the Project
The project involves collaboration from various organizations including:
- [Sociedade Socio Ambiental do Baixo Sao Francisco - Canoa de Tolda](https://canoadetolda.org.br/)
- [Federal University of Alagoas - UFAL](https://ufal.br/)
- [OpenMapDevelopment Tanzania (OMDTZ)](https://www.omdtz.or.tz/)
- [Rainbow Sensing](https://rainbowsensing.com/)
- [OpenDroneMap](https://opendronemap.org/)
- [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/)

### Project Activities on the Ground
Between June 27 and July 8, 2022, a team of experts from HOT collaborated with Canoa de Tolda to develop flood monitoring, 3D drone modeling, and community mapping in Ilha do Ferro, an at-risk population.

Key activities included:
- Preparing equipment acquired through the partnership with HOT (drones, batteries, fishing probes)
- River trips in fast boats to measure depth and flow in key areas; testing river bathymetry
- GPS measurements of terrain points in high, dry areas near the river and installation of control points on the ground in strategic locations
- GNSS base station installation in the city's highest area and construction of a polystyrene foam base for navigating the fishing probe and GPS on the river
- Drone flights and aerial imaging
- Community meetings to gather input on river management and alternative ways to share project outcomes
- Training sessions on equipment, software, and application usage
- Consultations with the university
