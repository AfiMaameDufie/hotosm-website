## CONTEXT

After two weeks of intense rain, gales, and hail in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, the collapse of the curtain of the July 14th hydroelectric dam has exacerbated an already critical situation, resulting in more than 100  deaths and 100 missing. More than one million people are affected. Nearly 70,000 have been evacuated and over one million homes are without drinking water. Additionally, 421,000 households lack electricity, and 115 municipalities are without telephone and internet services. There are 61 blocked roads and the Porto Alegre airport remains closed. The Guaíba River has reached record levels, flooding the historic center of Porto Alegre. The current estimated river level is 5,33 meters.

This event marks the second significant disaster in less than a year for the state, following a cyclone in September 2023 that left at least 31 dead. Climate change, along with the El Niño phenomenon, has intensified extreme weather conditions in the region.

**APPROACH**

Following the natural hazard disaster, the OSM Brazil Community, in coordination with the Open Mapping Hub in Latin America and the Caribbean, agreed to launch an activation on May 9th, 2024, to support response efforts. This decision was made after discussions with local partners in the region and as we continue to identify and prioritize data needs.

In June 2023, our team collaborated with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) joint-mission, along with the Porto Alegre government's education, health, sports, and social assistance departments, to address the damage caused by historic floods in Rio Grande. We will conduct a georeferenced assessment of the most affected facilities to assist in implementing reconstructions and transformations.

We will support data systematization and a participatory campaign for cartographic monitoring of the recovery works. This project is in partnership by the IADB, using tools like OpenStreetMap and open mapping platforms for transparent and free data management.

**OUTCOME AND IMPACT**

19 map tasks on Tasking Manager (see Wiki for more input).

So far, our projects have mapped:

* 55,082 buildings

* 1660 km of roads

* 1,228 km²

* 8,319 tasks mapped / 0 tasks left to map as of June 26th

* 33 mappers / 6 validators per project on average.
