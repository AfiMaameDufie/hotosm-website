  Text: "After years of gathering together in just one place for our annual conference,
    in 2022 we launched the *HOT unSummit*, a decentralized program of 13 global,
    regional, and local conferences worldwide, where each community brought together
    its own perspectives on open mapping, OpenStreetMap, humanitarian response, and
    social impact.\n\nWith the success of the *unSummit*, and with a little bit of
    rebranding, we are very excited to launch this year's **HOT Open Summit '23-24**
    and open our call for collaborations so more communities and organizations around
    the world bring their events as part of this global movements.\n\nThe call for
    collaborations will remain open till 2024, and the selection of event collaborations
    will be made three times a year, with decisions taken in November 2023, March
    2024 and July 2024. "

  Title: Conferences
  Text: "We encourage collaboration with local organizing committees (LOCs) for existing
    conferences that focus on open mapping or humanitarian/development work relevant
    to open mapping. These events should align closely with the criteria set for the
    HOT OpenSummit event collaborations. Priority will be given to conferences in
    [HOT's priority countries](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team/Priority_countries).
    \n\nExamples of previous conferences include: State of the Map Asia, State of
    the Map Tanzania, and the [Pacific Geospatial Conference](https://osgeo-oceania.org/pacific-geospatial-conference/).\n\n*Photo:

  Title: Interventions in 3rd Party Events
  Text: "We seek to support and collaborate with open mapping groups to bring open
    mapping to new or relevant audiences. This collaboration can take various forms,
    such as satellite events, content tracks, social events, etc. The goal is to promote
    open data awareness, advocacy, and collaborations/partnerships, particularly in
    non-traditional open mapping spaces and with map user audiences. \n\nExamples
    of these from the past year include: The Teto Brasil annual gathering,  Cidade
    em Foco (Brazil), Zimbabwe Institute of Geomatics Conference.\n"

  Title: Community Events
  Text: "We aim to support national or local open mapping communities coming together
    to share experiences, develop skills, build relationships, and, most importantly,
    to foster collaborative humanitarian open mapping activities. These community
    events do not need to be pre-existing and can be small-scale. Selection criteria
    for these events include their ability to provide value to the communities that
    HOT supports and their contribution to movement building. \n"
