**Why did you choose to apply for the internship?**

I was a student of Geomatics Engineering at Kathmandu University. I had a  passion and interest in field surveying, atlases and mapping even before joining engineering. As a result I got to know about OpenStreetMap (OSM) and became very interested in  mapping. I began contributing to various communities, conducting OSM trainings and started volunteering on various projects related to disaster response, humanitarian aid and economic development. More about my OSM Journey in this YouthMappers blog. 

In 2021, after being involved in an OSM community for more than a year, I wanted to learn and develop new skills in OSM. I was in my last semester and I needed an internship to complete my graduation. At the same time, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) had a call for applications for the HOT Data Quality Internship, so I jumped at the opportunity! I had a great OSM profile, was active in the OSM Nepal community and in the Geomatics Engineering Society (GES). 

**What did you enjoy about being a part of the internship?**

During the internship, I had the opportunity to communicate with fellow interns and supervisors from diverse countries and communities. The best part of the internship was being in contact with so many HOT staff members, including the Executive Director. For beginners and learners like me who are seeking professional career development, HOT encourages, hones, and develops oneâ€™s skills. Our supervisors Sam and Becky always made us feel comfortable and arranged coffee chats with several HOT staff members, which I enjoyed a lot.

**What was it like getting to know the other interns?**

Meeting new people is always interesting and it was even more interesting to meet the other 19 interns as they were from different countries. We were all divided by national boundaries, culture, and language but we were all united by HOT in a single classroom. The first friend I met was Tengku Almira from Indonesia who is so passionate and follows her dreams. We shared our culture, festivals, religion, geography and field of study with each other.

Becky arranged coffee chats with other interns. With Lassine and Viji, we discussed OSM activities in our regions, different mapathons, GIS Day, the HOT Summit, State of the Map US, and other OSM related topics. With Micheal and Gustavo, we discussed our OSM journeys, problems while mapping and validating and opportunities in OSM. I also enjoyed talking with friends from my country, Puspa and Sandhya and shared our experience of meeting new faces from different countries.

I am so glad that I also got a chance to have a chat with Bo Percival, the Director of Technology and Innovation at HOT. He told that he had  lived in Nepal for more than a year and loves Nepal and our festivals [Dashain ](https://www.stunningnepal.com/dashain-festival-in-nepal/)and [Tihar](https://www.tibettravel.org/nepal-festival/tihar-festival.html).
