Context: "Following the grave situation, we from OpenStreetMap Bangladesh (#OSMBD) community decided to push out urgent mapping tasks on the #hotosm tasking manager platform under #BangladeshFloodResponse2022. We are activating multiple tasking projects and more will be following periodically. We would urge you all to put your mapping gears on and support the vulnerable population in distress. We cannot assure direct aid from this, but surely this will assist the ongoing & future aid and recovery works by the different agencies. Letâ€™s #MapTheDifference and #Map4Resilience."
