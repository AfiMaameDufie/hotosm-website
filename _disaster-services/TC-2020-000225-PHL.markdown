<h2>Context</h2>

"The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said in its 5pm bulletin on Monday 9 November, that VAMCO strengthened from a tropical depression into a tropical storm. It now has maximum sustained winds of 65 kilometers per hour (km/h) and gustiness of up to 80 km/h, from 55 km/h and 70 km/h, respectively. The tropical storm is moving northwest at a much slower 15 km/h. Tropical Storm VAMCO will move generally northwestward today through tomorrow afternoon. Afterwards, it is forecast to turn westward and head towards the Bicol Region-Quezon area. A landfall over Bicol Region- Quezon area on Thursday is likely at this time. It is likely to reach Severe Tropical Storm category within 24 hours and may reach Typhoon category on Wednesday."
