<strong>DEBRIEFING</strong><br>



<strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong><br>

- A key takeaway for me was that we still have a struggle to connect with communities that, in this case, relationships have been established since 2010. Part of this is that the communities are very dynamic and the key people change frequently. The other part of this is that HOT has left these connections alone for too long.
- The biggest notable however, is the incredible feat of the Global Validation Team, and specifically around a handful who are responsible for validating around 10,000 of the tasks; keeping validation at pace with the mapping. This should be a shining example of validation going as you hope it would on a fairly long campaign.
