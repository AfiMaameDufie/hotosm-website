Haiti Earthquake - after Tropical Storm Grace passed over the earthquake zone, wind and rain added complications to the response efforts and caused additional damage. We received a request from the <strong>IFRC in the region to generate as much base data as possible in the next 5 days.</strong> Therefore we have continued to add mapping projects in the impacted area <a href="https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore?campaign=Haiti%20Earthquake%202021">(see here)</a>. MAXAR quickly released imagery of the area post-event and our partners at <strong>Mapbox and our Missing Maps - HeiGIT - was able to create a rapid preliminary damage assessment project</strong> on <a href="https://mapswipe.org/">Mapswipe</a> - note this is an experimental way to do remote damage assessment and therefore our priority will remain generating the pre-event base data.
