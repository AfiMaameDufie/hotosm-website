<h2>Size-up Details</h2>

<strong>Event Name:</strong> Beirut Port Explosion<br>
<strong>Type ofEvent:</strong> Sudden Onset<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> The Port in Beirut, Lebanon<br>
<strong>Geographic Scope:</strong> Significant portion of a City<br>
<strong>Estimated Humanitarian Impact:</strong>Likely the fatalities will surpass 100 but early numbers were claiming deaths in the ~70 range with thousands injured and potentially ~.5 million displaced.<br>
<strong>Estimated Duration:</strong> Day(s) to Week(s)<br>
<strong>Event Scope:</strong> Moderate Event<be>
<strong>Anticipated Needs:</strong> This will be a post-event mapping only, so we need to make sure we coordinate with locals to decide what tagging to use and how best to determine damaged, destroyed, etc.<br>
<strong>Local Contacts:</strong>This is an area I am still exploring, likely there is a community due to the amount of POIs and detail of the mapping. We know of some volunteer mappers who were nearby, but not local to Beirut.<br>
<strong>Request(s):</strong> Mappers in the area asking what can be done<br>
<strong>Need for Activation:</strong> A full activation is not required as everything is mapped, we would be in a support role to the local Lebanise mappers to determine tags, potential process & host imagery if some is captured and generally help with documentation and any other needs of the community.<br>
