"Tropical Cyclone Emnati has passed Mauritius and the French territory of La Reunion and is forecast to reach Madagascar on Tuesday, 22 Feb. Communities that were hardest-hit by Tropical Cyclone Batsirai are likely to be impacted again by Emnati, which is expected to make landfall between the cities of Mananjary and Manakara.
