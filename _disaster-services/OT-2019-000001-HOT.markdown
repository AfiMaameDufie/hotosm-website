"Millions of people are currently moving across Venezuela and several other countries in the Americas, and the humanitarian needs are growing. National Red Cross Societies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay are being supported by IFRC to deliver much-needed assistance. Recently, in response to a sustained increase in the number of migrants in the Americas region, the Movement has been establishing humanitarian operations in all the countries receiving migrants and ensuring strong connection with existing long-term regional plans for continuity of humanitarian services as well as social protection and communication initiatives."
