Context: "More than 220,000 people have been affected by the flooding in South Sudanâ€™s Unity State, according to the UN migration agency.

The floods have caused food shortages, malnutrition in children and a surge in the spread of various diseases.

Parts of South Sudan are experiencing their worst flooding in 60 years with the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) blaming climate change for the disaster."
