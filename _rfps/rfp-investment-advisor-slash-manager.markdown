# Organizational Background

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. We work together to provide map data which revolutionises disaster management, reduces risks, and contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Founded in August 2010, HOT is made up of skilled and committed staff and volunteers. Its primary goal is to apply the techniques of the OpenStreetMap project and the principles of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic and social development. HOT bridges communication gaps between the OpenStreetMap community and traditional GIS and government organizations. This is accomplished through:

* a remote volunteer network
* a network of OpenStreetMap contributors
* a deployment of staff to help people map their own communities

HOT currently leads community mapping projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia,  Liberia, Philippines, Tanzania, Turkey, and Uganda, and has worked with local OpenStreetMap communities on past projects in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Central African Republic, Haiti, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Rwanda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and in other countries. 

HOT is a stable, yet growing nonprofit organization, with an annual budget of $10 million, and a skilled and highly experienced staff of 85 that bring expertise in project management, disaster management and risk reduction, computer science, GIS, international development and social sciences.

# Request For Proposal

The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors is now seeking proposals from investment advisors to advise, manage, and administer approximately $15M in a diversified portfolio. We seek an overall investment strategy structured to meet the goals and objectives of the donation. 

HOT currently maintains approximately $20M in assets that mesh with the operating needs of the organization and extend coverage through the end of 2025. Approximately 50% ($10M) of the fund would need to be accessible for monthly operations, but invested in funds that provide higher yielding returns than overnight money market accounts. Approximately 25% ($5M) of the operating fund pool could be invested in funds that ensure a continued high level of income. 

The selected investment advisor would be expected to develop, and implement, an investment strategy that employs fixed income investment capabilities and to work with our staff to establish appropriate guidelines for the investment result. 

Please submit your written proposal to advise, manage, and administer the fund for HOT no later than **January 7, 2022** to:

Liz Chamberlain

Director of Finance and Operations
