## About the Assignment

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is requesting proposals from June 29th 2023 to July 14, 2023. The consultant shall assist HOT in maintenance and support of the Field
Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM).

## About Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team 
[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of more than 100 staff spread among 37 countries, HOT is an NGO which
supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and many others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster and humanitarian crises.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED’s Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities with a very
dedicated focus on local-led initiatives, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities, opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs around the world (Asia Pacific, East &amp;
Southern Africa, West &amp; Northern Africa, and Latin America &amp; the Caribbean), and finding talent that represents the communities with which we work.

## Scope of Work

While the open mapping ecosystem has a robust, mature Tasking Manager for remote mapping and several decent field mapping mobile applications, historically we have not had great tools to
coordinate field mapping.

To address this gap, HOT has undertaken to build a Field Mapping Tasking Manager, a combination of a mobile UX with a PC-based web application to coordinate field mapping tasks.

A description of the project can be [seen here on the GitHub page](https://github.com/hotosm/fmtm) (the ReadMe contains a narrative explanation of the tool as well as links to other resources to understand the project).

The FMTM has been built by a combination of HOT staff, contractors, and volunteers. Now in
beta release, it requires further effort for robustness, maintenance, improvement and user
support. HOT is seeking a contractor to fill this role for some time.

### Proposed Process
We see the process of Maintenance and support of the Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) as outlined below but we are open to recommendations for the approach and suggested outputs.

As primarily a maintenance and support role, this contract is expected to be based on hours worked, not specific deliverable items on a Gantt chart. Performance will be primarily monitored by indicators (uptime, user satisfaction, etc) rather than deliverable items, though some deliverable items will be expected as needed.

This contract is expected to average 32 hours per week (HOT normally considers 4 working days a full work week). However, the actual hours may vary depending on needs. During emergencies or outages, hours may exceed 32 per week, normally balanced by less hours during “slow” periods when all is working well. Life in the DevOps lane.

It also explicitly means countering the
gatekeeping that exists within the Free and Open Source Software communities, who often assume cultural norms that are not well-known outside of the Western tech sector.</li>
