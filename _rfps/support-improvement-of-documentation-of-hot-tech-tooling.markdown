## About the Assignment

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is requesting proposals from June 29th 2023 to July 14, 2023. The consultant shall assist HOT in improving/establishing technical documentation of HOT TECH Tooling.

## About Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of more than 100 staff spread among 37 countries, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and many others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster and humanitarian crises.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED’s Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities with a very
dedicated focus on local-led initiatives, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities, opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs around the world (Asia Pacific, East & Southern Africa, West & Northern Africa, and Latin America & the Caribbean), and finding talent that represents the communities with which we work.

## Scope of Work

HOT has been driving the development of several open-source tools in the open mapping sector and is currently building new services to support the open mapping movement. The technical documentation of those tools is often lacking, which hampers FOSS (free and open-source software) enthusiasts to better understand our tools so as to contribute.  Also, if we aim to move towards a more streamlined space where tools can be used in an integrated fashion or standalone fashion, we need to better understand the current architecture of tools so as to see how to evolve them into a more service design-oriented approach.

The scope of work entails documenting the solution architecture for one tool (ideally [Tasking Manager](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager)), while explaining to our product owners/managers how to go about documenting our tools as well as sharing/showing best practices by delivering on the actual documentation for one tool.

The second phase would be to support other product owners at HOT in the same process, so as to have a consistent way of documenting our toolset. 

And finally, to document how the different core tools currently interact, outline the dependencies, etc., so HOT will be able to deliver a more streamlined space in which our tools can be used in an integrated fashion or standalone.


### Proposed Process

We see the process of establishing architecture documentation as outlined below, but we are open to recommendations for the approach and suggested outputs.

1. First, walk the TECH & DATA team through the sort of documentation that ideally is established. 
2. Deliver on the Architecture Documentation for 1 Application, the Tasking Manager. While delivering this documentation, explain to our team the steps you undertake and how you go about it.
3. Propose a playbook for the other tool owners and guide them in the process of establishing similar documentation for the tools they drive.
4. Provide an overview of how the different tools/services possibly interact, as well as outline the dependencies. Propose the best way forward on how to enable other services to interact with our toolset. 

Important is that open and (ideally) free tools are being used to create diagrams/documentation, to enable maintainability by HOT and the community HOT serves.

## Proposal & Timeline

### Proposal Requirements

To be considered for a contract award under this request for proposals, please submit the written proposal (not exceeding 3 pages) in English.

The proposal must include the following information:

* Brief background information, including details of previous experience in relevant specialties
