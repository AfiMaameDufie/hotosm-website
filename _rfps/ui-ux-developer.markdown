## About the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team 

[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data, and tech. With a talented and diverse team spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO that supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments, and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data that aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED's Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities through decentralizing and opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs.

## Background

HOT has implemented an AI-assisted mapping initiative, [fAIr](https://www.hotosm.org/tech-suite/fair/), that empowers end users to create their own localized AI models (computer vision models). The target end users are humanitarian mappers in HOT's priority countries. fAIr is an open-source project, and all source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hotosm/fAIr). The awarded developer(s) would contribute pull requests to the GitHub repository and maintain the credit of their contributions. Currently, the project source code includes a front-end project in ReactJS and a back-end project in GeoDjango to handle the API. Full API documentation is available with [redoc](https://api-prod.fair.hotosm.org/api/swagger/), which will be the reference for the developer(s) who will implement the required work.

The front end is already developed using ReactJS and Leaflet for maps, so knowledge and experience working with maps are crucial for this assignment.

## Objective of the Assignment

HOT is aiming to refactor the whole user interface and increase the user experience (UX) based on suggestions from community members and advice/recommendations from the awarded UI/UX developer(s).

 <li>Develop a "Learn" section to guide new users in the new design</li>
 <li>Fixes and troubleshooting for issues during and after the implementation</li>
 <li>All programming languages, libraries, and packages used in this project need to be free and open source</li>
</ul>
