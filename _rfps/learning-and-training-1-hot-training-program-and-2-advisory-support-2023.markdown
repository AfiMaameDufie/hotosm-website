## About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of about 100 staff spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by TED’s Audacious Project, a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities: opening four regional hubs and scaling up its support to local mapping communities with the audacious goal of mapping an area home to one billion people in 94 countries at high risk of disasters or experiencing poverty - mapping with communities before they are in crisis.

# TRAINING PROGRAM for map users 

## Context
HOT plans to develop a training program targeted at employees of HOT’s partner organizations (including government and NGO staff) to provide awareness and understanding of open map data and tools, and ability to use open map data in decision-making. 

The goal is for HOT to provide quality training at scale to partner organizations, which enables them to use OSM to make informed decisions in their work. 

The Training Program concept(s) will be prototyped in 2 regions: Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) & tbc Latin America & the Caribbean (LAC) and/or Asia Pacific (AP) and we envision a course design that can be standardized and translated to other languages so that it can be scaled, adapted & replicated in other regions HOT works in. We are open to experimentation, so that we can package the most effective format(s) for other regions. 

## Target audience:
NGOs and government agencies that are interested in learning how to use open map data in their work within these [5 impact areas](https://www.hotosm.org/impact-areas/). Types of roles: Information Management Officers, GIS Officers, Data Analysts, Monitoring & Evaluation officers. E.g. this might include accessing and using OpenStreetMap data for decisions in service delivery, development initiatives, humanitarian action and advocacy. 

## The challenge: 
* We do not currently have an effective training/learning approach that effectively trains NGO & government actors and encourages and incentivises use of open map data in their organizations.
* It is a pathway in our Theory of Change, but we do not currently know how best to build capacity for partners’ sustainable and long-term use of OSM data (e.g. most effective style, pedagogy, format of delivery, etc.). 
* Previous efforts (e.g. classroom trainings delivered through donor-funded programs, LearnOSM website, virtual trainings [general or tailored to a specific organizations needs] etc) are not scalable. 

## Now:
We seek learning & training expertise to support us in the design and prototype phase of this Training Program for map users. So far, we have:
* Conducted research about what training exists already for this audience & some of the platforms they use
* Completed a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) & Change Impact Assessment (CIA) with 15 orgs in 5 countries in the ESA region to inform a draft concept
* Drafted a solution concept and draft curriculum based on the above learnings (see [supporting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CfWeWNGhNa22z3Gafb7GvaEuGXLLxny8YsSwsI12-Mc/edit?usp=sharing) 10 + 12-13)
* Suggested categories for partnership opportunities relating to the Program (e.g. to promote/endorse/sponsor/create content/support delivery) 
See [supporting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CfWeWNGhNa22z3Gafb7GvaEuGXLLxny8YsSwsI12-Mc/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

## Immediate Needs (pre May/June 2023): *Part 1 - scope of this RfP*
* Review insights generated from TNA & CIA to critique and evolve the concept(s) for prototyping
* Finalize the concept so that it is ready for prototyping (no later than mid-April), including by incorporating pedagogical best practices [sign off: HOT Program Lead]
* Lead on developing prototypes and plan for prototype testing in selected regions (with support of HOT’s team) 
* Iterate the concept based on prototype testing feedback from target audience representatives
* Update/refine the proposed curriculum 
* Advise which platforms are appropriate based on prototyping findings OR create requirements for the next phase of the Training Program to inform selection of an appropriate vendor/platform to host the content/course
We hope to complete this work ready to begin creating the training content / materials & inform starting a pilot phase with any relevant external expertise.

## Questions the Prototyping phase should answer:
* Is the concept/solution desirable? (Does it meet the needs of the target audience, and do they want to take part in it?)
* How do we do this? (What is the best format for the delivery of the training? Where should the training/course/content be hosted?) 
* Is there indication it will incentivise use of open map data / inspire action?
* Does this concept have a high chance of scale? 
* * Do we have reasons to believe the concept/solution is feasible? (We think the solution will work in the varying context & environments of the target audience, and therefore we want to pilot it)
* * Are there key regional differences we should be designing for? If so, what are these? 

We are open to being advised what level of fidelity the prototypes should be for this. Existing training materials/content can be used for the prototype, with required edits.
