## About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of about 100 staff spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by TED’s Audacious Project, a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities: opening four regional hubs and scaling up its support to local mapping communities with the audacious goal of mapping an area home to one billion people in 94 countries at high risk of disasters or experiencing poverty - mapping with communities before they are in crisis.

# TRAINING PROGRAM for map users 

## Context
HOT plans to develop a training program targeted at employees of HOT’s partner organizations (including government and NGO staff) to provide awareness and understanding of open map data and tools, and ability to use open map data in decision-making. 

The goal is for HOT to provide quality training at scale to partner organizations, which enables them to use OSM to make informed decisions in their work. 

The Training Program concept(s) will be prototyped in 2 regions: Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) & tbc Latin America & the Caribbean (LAC) and/or Asia Pacific (AP) and we envision a course design that can be standardized and translated to other languages so that it can be scaled, adapted & replicated in other regions HOT works in. We are open to experimentation, so that we can package the most effective format(s) for other regions. 

## Target audience:
NGOs and government agencies that are interested in learning how to use open map data in their work within these [5 impact areas](https://www.hotosm.org/impact-areas/). Types of roles: Information Management Officers, GIS Officers, Data Analysts, Monitoring & Evaluation officers. E.g. this might include accessing and using OpenStreetMap data for decisions in service delivery, development initiatives, humanitarian action and advocacy. 

## The challenge: 
* We do not currently have an effective training/learning approach that effectively trains NGO & government actors and encourages and incentivises use of open map data in their organizations.
* It is a pathway in our Theory of Change, but we do not currently know how best to build capacity for partners’ sustainable and long-term use of OSM data (e.g. most effective style, pedagogy, format of delivery, etc.). 
* Previous efforts (e.g. classroom trainings delivered through donor-funded programs, LearnOSM website, virtual trainings [general or tailored to a specific organizations needs] etc) are not scalable. 

## Now:
We seek learning & training expertise to support us in the design and prototype phase of this Training Program for map users. So far, we have:
* Conducted research about what training exists already for this audience & some of the platforms they use
* Completed a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) & Change Impact Assessment (CIA) with 15 orgs in 5 countries in the ESA region to inform a draft concept
* Drafted a solution concept and draft curriculum based on the above learnings (see [supporting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CfWeWNGhNa22z3Gafb7GvaEuGXLLxny8YsSwsI12-Mc/edit?usp=sharing) 10 + 12-13)
* Suggested categories for partnership opportunities relating to the Program (e.g. to promote/endorse/sponsor/create content/support delivery) 
See [supporting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CfWeWNGhNa22z3Gafb7GvaEuGXLLxny8YsSwsI12-Mc/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

## Immediate Needs (pre May/June 2023): *Part 1 - scope of this RfP*
* Review insights generated from TNA & CIA to critique and evolve the concept(s) for prototyping
* Finalize the concept so that it is ready for prototyping (no later than mid-April), including by incorporating pedagogical best practices [sign off: HOT Program Lead]
* Lead on developing prototypes and plan for prototype testing in selected regions (with support of HOT’s team) 
* Iterate the concept based on prototype testing feedback from target audience representatives
* Update/refine the proposed curriculum 
* Advise which platforms are appropriate based on prototyping findings OR create requirements for the next phase of the Training Program to inform selection of an appropriate vendor/platform to host the content/course
We hope to complete this work ready to begin creating the training content / materials & inform starting a pilot phase with any relevant external expertise.

## Questions the Prototyping phase should answer:
* Is the concept/solution desirable? (Does it meet the needs of the target audience, and do they want to take part in it?)
* How do we do this? (What is the best format for the delivery of the training? Where should the training/course/content be hosted?) 
* Is there indication it will incentivise use of open map data / inspire action?
* Does this concept have a high chance of scale? 
* * Do we have reasons to believe the concept/solution is feasible? (We think the solution will work in the varying context & environments of the target audience, and therefore we want to pilot it)
* * Are there key regional differences we should be designing for? If so, what are these? 

We are open to being advised what level of fidelity the prototypes should be for this. Existing training materials/content can be used for the prototype, with required edits.

# ADVISORY SUPPORT to HOT (Learning & Training: holistic approach) 

**Section 1** Training Program targets one of three key audiences HOT supports (map users). Internally, we are considering how best to support 2 key audiences (i) mappers (individuals and groups who “add to the map”) and (ii) map users (people or organizations who use maps for positive social impact or change). We need our approach to Learning & Training to be well coordinated. 

**Immediate Needs (June 2022): *Part 2 scope of this RfP*
We would like the consultant to provide advisory support to the following priorities:**

* 1.) **Support HOT Program lead to consider how HOT will build & curate one ‘library’ where all training resources can be homed** to solve our logistical challenges over current training approaches. That is, where the one central repository should be, which can then be used/delivered in/point to different places depending on the audience.
* * Review current options & propose for HOT Leadership decision [by end of April]
* 2.) **Defining the user journeys for different mappers and map users**
* * This is so that in future we can select a shortlist of locations where training will be provided, e.g. online course platforms, HOT’s website, etc, in order to center our users in our training choices 
* 3.) Conduct an audit of HOT’s current internal capacity and training materials, to assess where there are gaps with regard to training and where quality can be approved 
* * Outline which topics we are skilled to provide training in, who is able to provide those trainings, and where gaps exist.
* * Create guidelines & share lite best practice tips so that staff can self-assess any future training initiatives or materials that are created (we are open to recommendations e.g. checklist / self-assessment framework for staff developing new content for any external audience to use) 
* 4.) Based on 2+3, create a report which summarizes findings for 1, 2 and 3, and includes specific recommendations for how HOT can improve their own staff skills as trainers (for roles where this is a core competency). This can inform HOT planning and decisions for Y4 (Jul 2023-Jun 2024)

**Now: **
We have set up a new Task Team with 8-12 staff members from across the organization. These are roles which currently provide training to mappers and/or map users, or are exploring new learning/training related initiatives. This group meets monthly and can support additional workshops / meetings as required. They will be a key group to learn from for the above, and to engage in conducting and/or completing the above. 

**Further context:** We know that several key factors affect long term mapper engagement. High quality mapper skills and expertise is one of them, therefore we are committed to investment in resources / training opportunities for ongoing contribution to the open mapping movement. The second is trust in the integrity of the data, and ability for mappers to advocate for citizen generated data to influence change in their localities. 

**Required expertise:**
* Learning & development, specializing in design and delivery of training programs (instructional design)
* Experience working in / supporting clients in the non-profit & international development sector, in HOT’s regions / priority countries
* * Including organizations experiencing rapid growth (e.g. start-up), and remote organizations
* Human-centered design: prototyping and testing
