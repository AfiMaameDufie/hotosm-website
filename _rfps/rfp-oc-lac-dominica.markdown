# **About HOT**

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

In 2020 the work of the HOT community was recognized by TED’s Audacious Project, a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities: opening four regional hubs and scaling up its support to local mapping communities with the audacious goal of mapping an area home to one billion people in 94 countries at high risk of disasters or experiencing poverty - mapping with communities before they are in crisis.

# **About the Application**

Building on the success of the Open Cities project in Asia and Open Cities Africa, and GFDRR’s Code for Resilience, Open Cities Latin America and the Caribbean will be carried out in cities and selected regions, to engage local government, civil society and the private sector to develop information infrastructures necessary to meet 21st century urban resilience challenges. The project will be aligned with[ GFDRR’s Resilient Cities Program](https://www.gfdrr.org/urban-resilience) and implemented through a unique partnership between GFDRR and HOT, city governments, and a partner community composed of regional scientific and technology organizations, development partners, and technology companies to support Government activities in the selected cities. Following a competitive application process, an small implementing team in each city will receive funding, targeted training, technical support, and mentorship to organize, perform and achieve the following objectives:

1. Create and/or collate and release high quality open spatial data about the built environment, critical infrastructure, and natural hazards risks; to inform resilient urban planning and infrastructure projects while also benefiting the international risk modeling community

2. Enhance the local capacity and institutional development necessary to support the design and implementation of evidence-driven urban resilience interventions; through the:

3. Development of targeted products and/or tools (e.g., visualization tools, atlases, map series, or mobile applications) to assist key stakeholders to utilize risk information towards addressing natural disaster risk in the selected city;

4. Promote interaction and feedback mechanisms, and consolidate regional networks across OpenStreetMap and open source communities.

In each location, Open Cities LAC projects will inform decision-making through the development of a use-case, around a specific Problem Statement identified by the local implementing partner, local institutions and the regional World Bank teams by achieving the following components:

* Assessments on risk, resilience and preparedness information conducted to understand current data, human and capacity, and institutional contexts with the regards to the Problem Statement to address

* Participatory mapping of the target area and information completed using the global open collaborative mapping platform OpenStreetMap, and other relevant tools;

* Trainings on topics such as community mapping and data collection, data visualization and risk communication, and other related topics carried out;

* Local open source communities enhanced and/or cultivated;

* Communities of practice in LAC around urban resilience supported and/or developed; and

* Targeted information tools/products to support urban resilience interventions created.

Open Cities LAC will result in the development of new disaster risk data, with new tools/products to explore it, increased capacity among local populations, and new partnerships among diverse stakeholders. As part of this regional initiative, Open Cities LAC is soliciting applications from an implementation team, to collect data and develop resources to inform decision-making or support action around a specific Problem Statement.
