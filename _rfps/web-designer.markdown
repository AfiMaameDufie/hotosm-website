### **Role: Design Researcher and Web Designer (The Consultant)**

**There are two phases to this assignment:**\
**Phase I: **Research\
**Phase II: **Website redesign and build (to be informed by Phase I)\

**About the assignment:**

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is looking to redesign its website to reflect new organizational priorities, and the changes that have followed. HOT has evolved from a small NGO and global humanitarian mapping community into a growing, dynamic organization with decentralized regional Open Mapping Hubs, that form part of a larger global ecosystem of organizations and groups working to make an impact through data.

Our vision remains the same: a world where lack of data is no longer a contributing factor in human suffering or ability to access basic services by leveraging the power of OpenStreetMap - the world’s only truly global, open and inclusive digital map data source. However, recent organizational changes have added complexity to how we present ourselves as a connected system with a common vision of mobilizing a global movement, *and* as autonomous entities that engage with distinct regional audiences and partners - necessitating a re-envisioning of how we express our collective online identity and value proposition.

**About HOT**

[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) (HOT) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of about 100 staff spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO which supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED’s Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities, through decentralizing and opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs.

**About the Open Mapping Hubs**

HOT has set up three [regional Open Mapping Hubs](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/) in Asia-Pacific (2021), East & Southern Africa (2021), West & Northern Africa (2022), and is currently planning hub setup in Latin America and the Caribbean (TBC). These hubs engage with local mapping communities, facilitate knowledge exchanges, distribute funding, and provide training and support with the goal of massively scaling local edits to OpenStreetMap in 94 countries. The Open Mapping Hubs are a key feature of HOT’s expansion and decentralization.

**About OpenStreetMap**

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=2/71.3/-96.8) (OSM) is a free, editable map of the whole world and a vibrant data ecosystem where many different types of actors (from individual volunteers, the biggest tech companies in the world - UN, World Bank, NGOs) are all working in a single place to build the most complete accurate map of the world that has ever existed. OSM is released with an open-content license. Anyone can edit OpenStreetMap, and anyone can use OpenStreetMap. As HOT and the Open Mapping Hubs are part of the OSM community, the website must acknowledge this position.

**Context**

HOT is evolving to better support mapping communities across the world and needs to reposition itself as an ​​active constituent part of a much larger network, and **mobilize a movement that champions local people and open knowledge and data to solve local problems within the OSM ecosystem.** This should be reflected in how we present ourselves externally, including our online identity.

Presently, [the HOT website](https://www.hotosm.org/) does not fully reflect the new organizational priorities and direction, nor the decentralized structure as represented by the addition of **four regional Open Mapping Hubs and the building of an OSM movement.**

Our vision is to serve a diverse set of users in one website, providing different entry points into HOT’s work, prioritize key audiences and pay careful attention to user experience and optimize for participatory action.\
