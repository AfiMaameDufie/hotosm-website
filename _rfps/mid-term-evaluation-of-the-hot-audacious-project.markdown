## About Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team of more than 100 staff spread among 37 countries, HOT is an NGO which
supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and many others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster and humanitarian crises.

In 2020, the work of the HOT community was recognized by [TED’s Audacious Project](https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_firth_can_we_call_it_a_world_map_if_it_s_missing_a_billion_people), a collaborative philanthropic initiative that serves as a springboard for social impact on a grand scale, leading to an exciting new phase of growth. HOT is expanding its activities with a very
dedicated focus on local-led initiatives, including scaling up its support to local mapping communities, opening four regional Open Mapping Hubs around the world (Asia Pacific, East & Southern Africa, West & Northern Africa, and Latin America & the Caribbean), and finding talent that represents the communities with which we work.

## About the Assignment

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is requesting proposals from qualified consultants to undertake a mid-term evaluation of the HOT Audacious project. Over the last three years (2020-2022), HOT established four Regional Hubs (Eastern & Southern Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Western & Northern Africa), with the intent to support community-led mapping projects in 94 countries. Each Hub works on locally-led mapping projects implemented directly by the Hub or in collaboration with a local partner. Through various initiatives, HOT  provides grant funding, capacity-building opportunities or technical assistance in the collection and use of geodata to partners in the priority regions. Our vision for impact is **to enable people who are systematically underrepresented in countries at high risk of humanitarian crisis and multidimensional poverty to experience improved well-being, reduced suffering, and increased resilience to respond to crises through the creation, accessibility, and use of geo data.**

In implementing our current [Theory of Change](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JztyvqYt5wMgrQ7NNk_y3RvrQ4EGx1WO/view), and desiring to achieve the aspirations within it, we would like to document the evidence of our work, understand the trends in achieving the results, and its impact on our primary stakeholders. Our four long-term outcomes center:

1. Movement building, engaging underrepresented groups to contribute to the map and the movement;

2. Establishing vibrant local ecosystems;

3. Enabling the use of geodata within national and local governments, the private sector and;

4. Humanitarian and development organizations to better respond to humanitarian crises and to increase their overall effectiveness.

We have undertaken a significant number of projects and programs with local communities, volunteers, and partners around the world. We now want to assess the Audacious project impact in terms of its effectiveness, relevance, and value in achieving results. The outcomes of the mid-term evaluation will guide the final three years of project implementation and beyond.

**Purpose of the evaluation:** This mid-term evaluation aims to help us assess, document, and understand the intended and unintended outcomes and impact we have contributed to through our work.

**Objective 1:** To evaluate the **effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and likeliness of achieving the intended impact** of HOT Projects. Specific to ‘effectiveness’, to generate evidence demonstrating the outcomes (intended or unintended) and impact of the work we have implemented at the regional and global levels.

The following questions should be answered in demonstrating our work towards achieving this objective.

<ol>
<li>To what extent has HOT been <b>effective?</b> Has HOT been achieving its target outcomes? And what are the intended outcomes so far?</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>What significant changes have HOT and its partners contributed to while working in different communities? The changes should be related to our four major outcomes in our Theory of change, which include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Movement building, underrepresented groups actively contribute to the map and the movement;</li>
<li>Vibrant local data ecosystems are established;</li>
<li>National & local governments and the private sector use OSM to plan and contribute to humanitarian response and national development;</li>
<li>Humanitarian and development actors use open data to increase their effectiveness in reaching communities not previously visible.</li>
</ul>
<li>How have the different stakeholders, i.e., underrepresented groups, government, humanitarian and development actors, and the private sector, benefited from our work?
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To what extent has HOT been <b>efficient</b>? How well have resources (funds, people, time) been used?</li>
<li>To what extent will HOT Projects likely achieve their intended <b>impact</b>?
</li>
<li>To what extent are HOT projects <b>sustainable</b>? Will the benefits last? To what extent has the capacity of HOT’s partners been strengthened to continue program implementation and/or alter their approach?</li>
</ol>
<br>

Objective 2:
What lessons can be identified regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of implementing projects at the Hubs and global levels?
Objective 3: To propose actionable and pragmatic recommendations that inform HOT’s current and future portfolio of programs and projects\*
The following questions should be answered in demonstrating our work towards achieving Objective 3:
What aspects of the HOT Audacious project should be scaled up?
What could be done differently?
What programs or projects should be dropped?

\*Subject to discussion with hired Consultant(s)

# II. SCOPE OF WORK

<br>
SIDS are a distinct group of 38 UN Member States and 20 Non-UN Members/Associate Members of United Nations regional commissions that face unique social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. The list of SIDS according to the UN can be found [here](https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/list-sids). The WC-DRR-SIDS program is a global program being implemented by the Applied Mapping and Project Support team focused on implementing projects on disaster and risk resilience and will be conducted in 12 SIDS from all four hub-regions that HOT is working in. In its pilot phase, the program is being implemented in 3 small islands—Trinidad and Tobago, Timor-Leste, and Saloum Islands in Senegal—and is now expanding to 9 more SIDS for the second phase of the program. The following 21 SIDS are eligible to submit their RFPs for this program:

### COVID-19

HOT applies a general policy and protocols for field work in countries where activities are carried out. Our best efforts are put to foresee general risks in considering the COVID19 pandemic context, being applicable to any location, for all members of the implementation team. Its application to the latter will allow for greater control of working conditions. This includes strict requirements for all participants in the project to observe barrier measures, recommendations depending on situations with local communities and partners. The implementer will ensure the adherence of local protocols and rules for monitoring the health of each participant in case of signs of possible contagion. Applicants are required to take the COVID-19 local situation into account in the technical proposal methodology.
