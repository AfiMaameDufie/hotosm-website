# Background

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team United States, Inc. (HOT) applies the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development. Founded in the wake of the Haiti earthquake of 2010, responders and organizations recognized the need for accurate, accessible maps to aid in humanitarian response and the potential for international development interventions. Since then, HOT has utilized its network of tens of thousands of volunteers to contribute to OpenStreetMap, the free and editable map of the world. HOT’s network and tools enable everyone, local or international, to have an impact by putting places on the map.

The West and Northern Africa Hub (WNAH) is a branch of HOT that covers 24 countries in the region with the mission of making open data and free software a decision-making tool for development focusing on communities. The WNAH works with humanitarian organizations, governments, civil society, private operators, institutions, and other actors to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) tools; data collection, spatial analysis, and state-of-the-art cartographic production are the essential tools that the Hub will promote for socio-economic decision-making.

We want to be closer to communities so data and maps can be a tool for analysis and decision-making to improve people's lives. Through a regional approach, by assisting local communities using open-source mapping data, tools, and software, we intend to contribute to community development by improving their livelihoods.

# Project

**Strengthening Gender Resilience Against Disaster Project**

Disasters disproportionately impact women and girls, who often face increased vulnerabilities due to social and economic inequalities. Worldwide, women comprise 52% of the population yet represent 70% of all disaster deaths. In addition, women are more likely to be displaced by disasters, to experience violence and exploitation, and to face barriers to accessing essential services.
There are several reasons women and girls are more vulnerable to disasters. These include:
Gender roles and responsibilities: Women are often responsible for childcare and household duties, which can limit their ability to evacuate or prepare for disasters.
Lack of access to resources and information: Women may not have access to the same resources and information as men, such as early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans.
Social and cultural norms: In many cultures, women are expected to be submissive and defer to men, making asserting their needs and priorities difficult in disaster situations.
The consequences of disasters for women and girls can be devastating. They may lose their homes, livelihoods, and loved ones. They may also experience physical and psychological trauma. More needs to be done to address the gendered impacts of disasters. This project aims to significantly contribute to this effort by promoting gender-responsive disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) initiatives.

**Project’s Objectives:**

* Provide women groups with added portfolios to build on disaster resilience

* Map and analyze women's groups/organizations to adapt training materials to their needs

* Develop strategies and recommendations to enhance the resilience and empowerment of women and children in the face of disasters

* Build the capacity of 20 women groups in two project countries (Cameroon and Sierra Leone) using a training-of-trainers approach

* Provide micro-grants to four women groups to train women and girls and conduct remote mapping activities in their respective communities

* Support women groups with technical skills and tools to promote open data and tools in their organizations

* Co-develop and organize campaigns to promote women’s involvement in Disaster preparedness, awareness, and response to disasters in their communities

* Organize workshops bringing together women groups, stakeholders, and national actors and share knowledge. and resource opportunities for effective women empowerment.
