## About the organization
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and technology. With a talented and diverse team spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO that supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and for attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

## The Project

HOT's Technology and Data team is looking for an organization with expertise in software development to support us with the development of one of our key applications, the HOT Tasking Manager.

The HOT Tasking Manager, an [open online mapping platform ](https://www.tasks.hotosm.org/)(https://www.tasks.hotosm.org/), aims at supporting mappers that need to simultaneously map a geographic area on OSM for humanitarian or anticipatory response reasons. The platform enables communities to collectively map an area on OSM. 

The HOT Tasking Manager has been in maintenance mode for the past years. We are now moving into a new mode in which we would like to start adding user functionalities by integrating or loosely coupling other services to improve the overall user experience for mappers and map users.
Some ideas are to integrate/link the Tasking Manager with a larger variety of  Imagery Services, Quality Control Services, AI Assisted Mapping Services, Mobile Mapping Services, Map Visualization tools, etc. 

We are specifically looking for an organization (hereafter referred to as “The Consultant”) that can help us with Software Development.  

The Consultant will be key in ensuring the Tasking Manager tool meets the software development and usability needs of HOT’s wide-ranging stakeholder groups. 

Through open-source software development practice and a user-centric approach, the Consultant will help with day-to-day software development.

## Timeline

* Duration: 12 months support contract 

* Start date: Ideally, we would like to start as soon as the Consultant is selected (mid-September/beginning of October).

## Scope of Work

The Consultant will be expected to provide software development support for the evolution of HOT’s Tasking Manager tool as per the Product Strategy set by the HOT Product Manager.
The work will cover both frontend and backend support. This includes:
* Working on new feature implementations, bug fixes and enhancements, and general improvements to the codebase
* Help guide architectural decisions and operational feasibility by working alongside multiple stakeholders and converting high-level ideas into detailed specifications and actionable issues.
* Work along with Service Providers to ensure the integration/linkage of other services.
* Help support the success of the open-source community by developing documentation, flowcharts, layouts, diagrams, charts, code comments, and clear code.

The work will be done remotely, but HOT will request flexible working to ensure the best collaboration, both with HOT internal employees and with Service Providers. A considerable overlap with the Indian, EUR, and USA time zones is required.

Ideally, we can engage with 1 full-time Mid-Senior FrontEnd Developer and 1 full-time Mid-Senior BackEnd Developer in this contract. We are open to alternative proposals.
The Developers work will be steered by the HOT Product Manager, and the developers will closely collaborate as well with the HOT DevOps Team, the HOT Senior Architect, as well as FOSS Volunteers, and potentially other contractors.
