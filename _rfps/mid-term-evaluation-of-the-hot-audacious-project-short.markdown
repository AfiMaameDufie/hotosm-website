## About the Assignment

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is **requesting proposals from qualified consultants** to undertake a mid-term evaluation of the HOT Audacious project. Over the last three years (2020-2022), HOT established four Regional Hubs (Eastern & Southern Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Western & Northern Africa) to support community-led mapping projects in 94 countries. Each hub works on locally-led mapping projects implemented directly by the hub or in collaboration with a local partner. Through various initiatives, HOT provides grant funding, capacity-building opportunities, or technical assistance in collecting and using geodata to partners in the priority regions. Our vision for impact is **to enable people who are systematically underrepresented in countries at high risk of humanitarian crisis and multidimensional poverty to experience improved well-being, reduced suffering, and increased resilience to respond to crises through the creation, accessibility, and use of geo data.**

We have undertaken a significant number of projects and programs with local communities, volunteers, and partners around the world. We now want to assess the Audacious project impact in terms of its effectiveness, relevance, and value in achieving results. The outcomes of the mid-term evaluation will guide the final three years of project implementation and beyond.

**Purpose of the evaluation:** This mid-term evaluation aims to help us assess, document, and understand the intended and unintended outcomes and impact we have contributed to through our work. Please refer to the [Terms of Reference here](https://www.hotosm.org/rfps/mid-term-evaluation-of-the-hot-audacious-project/) for more information and details on the evaluation. Questions or clarifications for this call for Proposals should be sent to [merlteam@hotosm.org](merlteam@hotosm.org).

The proposal must include the following information:
