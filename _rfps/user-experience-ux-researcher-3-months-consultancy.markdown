Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) sits at the nexus of participatory mapping, community-led development, humanitarian response, open data and tech. With a talented and diverse team spread around the globe, HOT is an NGO that supports a dynamic global community of thousands of dedicated volunteers using maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with humanitarian and development partners like the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies, governments and others, the HOT community maps in solidarity with those affected by or at risk of disaster, contributing the maps and data aid workers need to do their lifesaving work.

## The Project

HOT is looking to engage the services of an individual with expertise in user experience (UX) research, design and information architecture. We  are currently in the process of redesigning the HOT website. Our [current website](https://www.hotosm.org/) was built over 5 years ago. Since that time, HOT has grown in geographic reach, scope, and audiences. We have worked with a website engineering company to build the foundations of the site and have begun internal analyses of our key users. We are looking for someone to take these building blocks and guide us in completing the website to center our users’ needs and ensure the usability of the site is effective in meeting our stated goals.

The Consultant will guide HOT in ensuring the website meets the needs of the HOT’s wide-ranging stakeholder groups and allows them to efficiently reach the information they are looking for. Through an equitable design process that centers people, the Consultant will: build on existing user research to finalize clear user personas and user stories, conduct user testing to determine the final Information Architecture of the website, update and create new design wireframes for the website CMS. This UX project will culminate in making recommendations and advising our website engineers on the updated design for the site. 

## Timeline

We estimate the timeline to be approximately 3 months and would like to start immediately. We are aiming for a website launch in May. 

## Scope of Work

This is a **three month** contract on the basis of remote work. The Consultant will be expected to:
1. Review and build on existing user research for the HOTOSM website  and **finalize 10 user personas** and associated user stories

4. Propose and **adapt existing wireframes**, taxonomies developed for the website (Wagtail- CMS) in order to meet user need
