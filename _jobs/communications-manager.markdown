**About HOT**
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a Washington, D.C.- based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 200,000 people with ground operations in six countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need, serving humanitarian partners such as UNHCR, American Red Cross, and MSF- Doctors Without Borders.


### About the Position
The Communications Manager will work closely with HOT’s Director of Partnerships and Community, Operations Manager, Executive Director, and field offices to plan and coordinate all of HOT’s external communications. As HOT expands to a greater number of countries and increasingly diverse projects, there is considerable need to keep HOT’s community (donors, partners, volunteers) updated while also raising the profile of HOT.  HOT’s diverse audiences, communications channels, and geographic reach require a cohesive strategy to convey impact. This role will involve increasing the standard and reach of all HOT communications across all methods; social media, television, radio/podcast, media coverage & press releases.
