# About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more 200,000 people with ground operations in eight countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need. HOT works closely with humanitarian and development partners including the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, World Bank, and UN OCHA, among others.

# About the Position
HOT is a small organization with a collegial, remote work culture that enables our global reach. In 2019, we exceeded 100 staff including the global HQ team and staff in country office and project locations. HOT is looking for our first Talent Manager to support our existing team and help us envision creative approaches for fostering a principled, open, remote, flexible and fun working environment that attracts and retains the best talent. 

The Sr. Talent Manager will begin as HOT’s sole full-time HR representative, working closely alongside HOT’s Global Operations Manager and reporting to HOT’s Executive Director. The position will support 100+ staff globally across four regions: Asia, East Africa, West Africa, and Latin America/Caribbean. It is expected that over time the Sr. Talent Manager will supervise an HR focal point in each region. This role will have significant responsibility and creative license to shape the future workplace culture of HOT and help us achieve our goals around attracting and retaining a diverse, gender-balanced workforce, while meeting our duty of care to staff. The Sr. Talent Manager will oversee and execute all aspects of talent management across recruitment, onboarding, performance assessment, compensation/benefits, learning and development, and deployment planning. The role is also responsible for traditional HR duties including managing outsourced payroll and benefits providers, policies, compliance, safety, grievances, EEO, guidelines for office start-up, maintenance and shut down.

# About You
We’re looking for a human resource professional with a proclivity toward innovation.

You should be comfortable working in fully remote, global organizations across time zones and cultures, in thinking strategically but also jumping into the hands-on work required in HR administration.  In your application, we’d like to know about your experience managing change in organizations: what aspects of organizational performance, diversity and inclusion, and management support that have you set out to impact.  What are you most proud of achieving? We’d also like to hear about your experience establishing or maintaining a responsive, engaging organizational culture.
