# About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of hundreds of thousands of people with ground operations in many countries around the world. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need. HOT is expanding its reach as part of our new [Audacious Project](https://audaciousproject.org/ideas/2020/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team).

HOT typically works with a range of international and national partners (including government, NGO, and civil society) as well as interacts frequently with the HOT global network. Projects span sectors and typically focus on participatory mapping using OpenStreetMap, data analysis and storytelling, and training/capacity building of national and international partner organizations.

HOT is soliciting CVs of experienced mid-career digital development and humanitarian professionals to assist in the management of our Disaster Services and volunteer Activations, starting as soon as possible (October 2020). This assignment is expected to last 6 months with the possibility of extension.
