## About HOT:

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 175,000 people with ground operations in eight countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

HOT is soliciting CVs of experienced mid-career digital development and humanitarian professionals to assist in the management of our Disaster Services and volunteer Activations, starting as soon as possible (April 2020). This assignment is expected to last 6 months with the possibility of extension.

## Profile:

HOT typically works with a range of international and national partners (both government, NGO, and civil society) as well as interact frequently with the HOT global network. Projects span sectors and typically focus on participatory mapping using OpenStreetMap, data analysis and storytelling, and training/capacity building of national and international partner organizations.

This is a full time position on the basis of remote work initially, but will likely include travel to country team offices, and potentially areas with active disaster activations. The candidate for this position should have:

* Experienced in Information Management and its processes and applications in humanitarian crises and disaster response, and specifically comfortable with geospatial data.

Assist with creating overviews of available data and 3/4/5Ws in disaster response situations, and work to prioritize and task HOT volunteer mappers on the basis of incoming requests for (baseline) geospatial data on the basis of those, in coordination with the Activation Lead.

* Produce regular (data) communications and analyses on HOT’s work and available data during activations, such as bulletins and maps.

* Actively assist organizations responding to disaster to make effective use of open geospatial data, specifically OSM data, HOT volunteer mappers and
