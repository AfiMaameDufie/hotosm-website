# About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more 250,000 people with ground operations in six countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need. HOT works closely with humanitarian and development partners including the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, World Bank, and UN OCHA, among others. Over the past the HOT community has mapped an area home to more than 150 million people, providing crucial data for humanitarian response to nearly 100 disasters and crises. In 2020, HOT was awarded funding from [The Audacious Project](https://audaciousproject.org/ideas/2020/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team). Over the next five years, this funding will enable HOT to scale up its support to local mapping communities with the aim of mapping an area home to one billion people, adding places at high risk of natural disaster or experiencing poverty.

# Role Profile
The Regional Hub Director serves as HOT’s most senior representative in each of HOT’s four global regions (Latin America and the Caribbean, West Africa, East Africa, and South/East Asia and Pacific). As part of our five-year [Audacious Project vision](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/audacious-announcement/) to map an area home to one billion people affected by disasters or multidimensional/extreme poverty, the Regional Hub Director is responsible for developing and executing a strategy for expanding use of free, open, and accessible geospatial data to 20-25 countries in their region over a period of 4-5 years. The Director will oversee a physical hub location where approximately 13 staff work across HOT's partnerships, community engagement, Microgrants, technical assistance, communications, and technology innovation teams.

## Responsibilities
* Setup and development of HOT’s regional presence including a physical office location.
* Day-to-day management of a regional team (mix of direct and indirect reports).
* Adapt, localize and apply HOT’s global strategy to the region, while coordinating and liaising with the HOT Global team and Hub Directors in other regions.
* Manage and develop local and regional partnerships with disaster management agencies, national statistical offices/mapping agencies, ministries of health, I/NGOs, and other partners in conjunction with a Hub Partnerships Manager and global partnerships team.
* Represent HOT regionally at the national and international level, leading/supervising the organization of meetings, workshops and other partnership engagements, and presenting at conferences.
* Direct the support and growth of OpenStreetMap and open mapping communities in all countries that are part of the region, including provision and management of (small) grants, sustainability planning, training, and technical assistance in conjunction with the Hub community team.
* Manage and build relationships with donors and other partners in the region and coordinate regional new business development.
* Oversee finances, HR, and hub location administration and logistics.

* Work experience at a senior management / director level with experience managing teams and budgets of at least $200,000 USD.
* Entrepreneurial: thrives in a startup-like environment, enjoys building teams and strategy.
* Well-connected: ongoing personal relationships with leadership at multiple regional NGOs and ideally a significant history of projects involving government data users.
* Clear, influential communicator and comfort with high profile public speaking/engagement.
* Demonstrated successes working in open source and open data projects; GIS and OpenStreetMap experience a plus but not required.

* Bachelor’s degree required, Master’s degree preferred.
