# About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 230,000 people with ground operations in eight countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

# About the Role
The **Scrum Master/Mentor** will oversee the scrum and development teams and coach and mentor the HOT tech team as agile/scrum is adopted more broadly across the organisation. You will be an Agile advocate and scrum superstar, which will motivate those around you. The **Scrum Master/Mentor** will act as a buffer between the scrum teams and module owners and maintain a safe working environment for the team by helping with conflict resolution.

You will need to be able to think fast to help solve problems. Strong communication skills are essential as you will be communicating with the development and scrum teams and the module owners. You will be experienced in managing stakeholders and multiple priorities and are dedicated to delivering win-win solutions. 

The **Scrum Master/Mentor** will advance HOT’s mission by operationalizing the HOT_Tech core ethics:

* **Human:** Our **Human** ethic is our commitment to people as our priority. At the centre of all our technology sits a human. The ultimate purpose of our technology is to improve human conditions. We use technology to enable and amplify human efforts. 

* **Open:** Our **Open** ethic permeates all we do. Our actions  reflect radical openness and transparency. We encourage open inputs and outputs. Our team and technology openly welcomes and engages community, collaboration and contribution.

* **Truth:** Our **Truth** ethic reflects an OpenStreetMap core principle; the ‘truth on the ground’. Our activities and decisions will be guided by this ethic, where not easily resolved will defer to this as a core principle in order to define what best reflects the truth on the ground.

* **HOT_Tech Principles** > Can be found here >> https://github.com/hotosm/tech/blob/master/principles/README.md 

The **Scrum Master/Mentor** will coordinate and collaborate with key HOT_Tech supporting functions including the Director of Technology, Senior Technical Lead, Module Owners and Community Manager.
 
## Priority Areas for Action and Responsibilities

* **Agile/Scrum Mastery:** Agile/Scrum will be second nature to you. You live and breathe, build measure, learn.  You have led scrum teams before and are agile in the way you deliver agile.

* **Stewardship of Agile/Scrum Methodologies:** You know that there are two types of organisations, those that do and those that don’t...yet. In the past, you have helped organisations and staff learn the ways of scrum and benefit from its adoption by an organisation. You will bring in the methodology, frameworks and procedures to ensure successful adoption. You believe that you can change the world, one sprint at a time. 

* **Agile/Scrum Coaching and Mentorship:** You know what it takes to adopt agile/scrum personally, professionally and organisationally. You know that there are two types of people, those that love agile and those that don’t...yet.
