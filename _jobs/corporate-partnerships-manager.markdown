# About Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team 

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goal. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more 230,000 people with ground operations in six countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need. Leveraging field expertise we’ve built over the past 5+ years, HOT continues to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and local community support to increase support for Missing Maps and humanitarian partners including the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, World Bank, and UN OCHA, among others. 

HOT partnerships currently span (i) impact partners who use the maps HOT volunteers create to make impact in the humanitarian sector (e.g. MSF, Red Crosses, etc); (ii) corporate partners who contribute finances and volunteering time to HOT's mission (e.g. Salesforce, Accenture, etc); (iii) strategic technology partners who have an interest in better OpenStreetMap data to power their products in locations within HOT's mission (e.g. Facebook, Microsoft, etc). Under HOT’s Audacious Project, each of these areas will expand.
